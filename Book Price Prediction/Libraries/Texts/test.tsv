The murderers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, were arrested six years after the crime. The author tries to explore the circumstances that surrounded the mass murder, and the repercussions that followed. He delves into the complex psychological relationship that the two murderers, for though the murders were committed in cold blood, the two men were, at the heart of it all, still human.

Man's Search for Meaning	Viktor E Frankl	Paperback,– 7 Feb 2008	4.3 out of 5 stars	800 customer reviews	"Man's Search for Meaning was first published in 1946. Victor Frankl was a leading psychologist in Vienna when he was arrested for being a Jew during the Nazi regime. He survived holocaust and used his experiences to write this book. He propounded the theory that it is Man's constant search for meaning that allows him to survive even the most brutal, the most degrading situations in his life.
He said there are only two races in the world, the decent and indecent. They will maintain their innate beliefs, no matter which side they are on. The decent ones will try to help the fellow human beings and the indecent ones will be selfish and serve themselves at the cost to the others.
Frankl's views were different from those of the leading psychologist of his times, Freud and Adler. His research was intensely personal and unique. His findings of human behaviour were based on the most extenuating circumstances that humans face. He suffered holocaust along with several other inmates and he observed their behaviour closely. He found that those with a capability to focus on love were the ones that survived. He based this observation on a long walk he was forced into by his captors. His companion spoke about his wife. This made Frankl think about his wife and the thought of her took his mind away from his current agony of being hit with rifle butts by his captors for dawdling.
The book has been listed as one of the 10 most influential books. It has a message of hope that has continued to inspire readers down the years.
About the author:
Victor Emile Frankl was a successful neurologist and psychologist dedicated to saving people from suicidal depression. He was born into a Jewish family because of which he was prosecuted by the Nazi regime after they took over Austria. He was banished to Nazi Theresienstadt Ghetto along with his family in 1942. He continued to practice as a Psychologist there and continued to treat people with depression. He was sent to Auschwitz in 1944 where he spent several months before they were liberated in 1945. He watched his family die in concentration camps.
He used his experiences as a holocaust survivor in his bestselling book Man's search for meaning. He worked at the Vienna Polyclinic for Neurology. He lectured extensively and conducted seminars all over the world. He lectured at the University of Vienna and Harvard. He wrote 39 books which were translated in several languages. He died of heart failure in 1997."	Psychology (Books)	Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts	150.0

She's a Jolly Good Fellow	Sajita Nair	Paperback,– 1 Jan 2010	5.0 out of 5 stars	4 customer reviews	Second Lieutenants Deepa Shekhar and Anjali Sharma have an important task at hand: convince their male counterparts that they too are assets to the Indian Army–rather than merely those with assets. When the 23-year-olds are transferred to a remote army unit, several hilarious situations follow, thanks to the stark novelty of a feminine presence in the traditionally male army. However, with each passing day, the differences in their personalities begin to emerge. Deepa is more 'officer': she insists on being called 'Sahab' and even takes to swearing like the troops. Anju is more 'lady': she can't give up her make-up and Mills & Boon romances. Or resist the charms of a certain dashing young officer, despite her friend's warnings to stay away. The girls frequently fall out and get back together, but face the same dilemma: is any man worth more than their uniform?	Indian Writing (Books)	Romance	399.0

An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions	Amartya Sen	Paperback,– 6 Mar 2014	4.4 out of 5 stars	93 customer reviews	"After regaining independence in 1947, India immediately adopted a firmly democratic political system. The famines of the British era disappeared, along with economic stagnation; despite a recent dip, India's growth remains among the fastest in the world. Yet, Drèze and Sen argue, there have been failures both to foster participatory growth and to make good use of the public resources generated by economic growth to enhance people's living conditions.
This book presents a powerful analysis not only of India's deprivations and inequalities, but also of the restraints on addressing them - and of the possibility of change through democratic practice."	Asian History	Politics	366.0

WHO REALLY KILLED THE HADLER FAMILY?

I just can't understand how someone like him could do something like that.
Amid the worst drought to ravage Australia in a century, it hasn't rained in small country town Kiewarra for two years. Tensions in the community become unbearable when three members of the Hadler family are brutally murdered. Everyone thinks Luke Hadler, who committed suicide after slaughtering his wife and six-year-old son, is guilty.
Policeman Aaron Falk returns to the town of his youth for the funeral of his childhood best friend, and is unwillingly drawn into the investigation. As questions mount and suspicion spreads through the town, Falk is forced to confront the community that rejected him twenty years earlier. Because Falk and Luke Hadler shared a secret, one which Luke's death threatens to unearth. And as Falk probes deeper into the killings, secrets from his past and why he left home bubble to the surface as he questions the truth of his friend's crime.

What We Talk about When We Talk about Rape	Abdulali Sohaila	Hardcover,– 25 Oct 2018	4.3 out of 5 stars	8 customer reviews	"Sohaila Abdulali was the first Indian survivor to speak out about rape. Gang-raped as a teenager in Bombay and indignant at the deafening silence on the issue in India, she wrote an article for a woman's magazine questioning how we perceive rape and rape victims. Thirty years later, she saw the story go viral in the wake of the fatal 2012 Delhi rape and the global outcry that followed.
Writing from the viewpoint of a survivor, writer, counsellor and activist, and drawing on three decades of grappling with the issue personally and professionally and her work with hundreds of survivors, Sohaila Abdulali looks at what we-women, men, politicians, teachers, writers, sex workers, feminists, sages, mansplainers, victims and families-think about rape and what we say.
She also explores what we don't say. She asks pertinent questions: Is rape always a life-defining event? Does rape always symbolize something? Is rape worse than death? Is rape related to desire? Who gets raped? Is rape inevitable? Is one rape worse than the other? Who rapes? What is consent? How do you recover a sense of safety and joy? How do you raise sons? Who gets to judge?"

And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specialising in student loans, the three realise they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.
So they begin plotting a way out. Maybe there's a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they have to leave law school, pretend they are qualified and go into battle with a billionaire and the FBI.

____________________

In the 1960s Enzo Ferrari emerged as the dominant force in sports cars in the world, creating speed machines that were unbeatable on the race track. In America, the Ford Motor Company was quickly losing ground as the pre-eminent brand. Henry Ford II saw a solution. He decided to declare war on Ferrari, to build a faster car than anything Ferrari had brought to the track, and to beat him at the world's biggest race, Le Mans. Ferrari was just as determined to see off this challenge from across the Atlantic.

With practically no safety regulations in place in the European Grand Prix races, horrific accidents were routine, with both drivers and spectators killed in many races. The stakes were incredibly high, money and men were thrown at the competition, neither Ford or Ferrari would accept anything but victory. The battle to become the fastest in the world truly became a race to the death."	Car Racing (Books)	Sports	724.0

She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity	Carl Zimmer	Paperback,– 10 Jul 2018	4.7 out of 5 stars	4 customer reviews	SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2018 BAILLIE GIFFORD PRIZE FOR NON-FICTION 'Elegantly written, wittily constructed . . . My science book of the year.' Robin McKie, Observer, 'Best Books of 2018' She Has Her Mother’s Laugh presents a profoundly original perspective on what we pass along from generation to generation. Charles Darwin played a crucial part in turning heredity into a scientific question, and yet he failed spectacularly to answer it. The birth of genetics in the early 1900s seemed to do precisely that. Gradually, people translated their old notions about heredity into a language of genes. As the technology for studying genes became cheaper, millions of people ordered genetic tests to link themselves to missing parents, to distant ancestors, to ethnic identities . . . But, Zimmer argues, heredity isn’t just about genes that pass from parent to child. Heredity continues within our own bodies, as a single cell gives rise to trillions of cells that make up our bodies. We say we inherit genes from our ancestors – using a word that once referred to kingdoms and estates – but we inherit other things that matter as much or more to our lives, from microbes to technologies we use to make life more comfortable. We need a new definition of what heredity is and, through Carl Zimmer’s lucid exposition and storytelling, this resounding tour de force delivers it. Weaving together historical and current scientific research, his own experience with his two daughters, and the kind of original reporting expected of one of the world’s best science journalists, Zimmer ultimately unpacks urgent bioethical quandaries arising from new biomedical technologies, but also long-standing presumptions about who we really are and what we can pass on to future generations.

Pakistan: Courting the Abyss	Tilak Devasher	Paperback,– 28 Dec 2016	4.3 out of 5 stars	11 customer reviews	Recent writings on Pakistan have tended to focus on the role of the Pakistan Army, the nuclear programme, terrorism, Pak-Afghan and Pak-US relations and, of course, Indo-Pak relations. Pakistan: Courting the Abyss goes beyond sensationalist headlines and current crises like terrorism and tensions with India, to the deeper malaise that afflicts the nation. The book examines issues like identity, the looming water crisis, the perilous state of education, the economic meltdown and the danger of an unrealized 'demographic dividend' that have been eating the innards of Pakistan since its creation. It looks back at the Pakistan movement, where the seeds of many current problems were sown - the opportunistic use of religion being the most lethal of these. Pakistan: Courting the Abyss questions the flawed prescriptions and responses of successive governments, especially during military rule, to these critical challenges that have brought Pakistan to an abyss where it risks multi-organ failure, unless things change dramatically in the near future.

From the author of The Guest Room, a powerful story about the ways an entire life can change in one night: A flight attendant wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man - and no idea what happened.

Cassandra Bowden is no stranger to hungover mornings. She's a binge drinker, her job with the airline making it easy to find adventure, and the occasional blackouts seem to be inevitable. She lives with them, and the accompanying self-loathing. When she awakes in a Dubai hotel room, she tries to piece the previous night back together, counting the minutes until she has to catch her crew shuttle to the airport. She quietly slides out of bed, careful not to aggravate her already pounding head, and looks at the man she spent the night with. She sees his dark hair. His utter stillness. And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police - she's a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home - Cassie begins to lie. She lies as she joins the other flight attendants and pilots in the van. She lies on the way to Paris as she works the first class cabin. She lies to the FBI agents in New York who meet her at the gate. Soon it's too late to come clean-or face the truth about what really happened back in Dubai. Could she have killed him?

The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (Penguin Classics)	Jacob Burckhardt	Paperback,– 28 Jun 1990	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"For nineteenth-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, the Italian Renaissance was nothing less than the beginning of the modern world - a world in which flourishing individualism and the competition for fame radically transformed science, the arts, and politics. In this landmark work he depicts the Italian city-states of Florence, Venice and Rome as providing the seeds of a new form of society, and traces the rise of the creative individual, from Dante to Michelangelo. A fascinating description of an era of cultural transition, this nineteenth-century masterpiece was to become the most influential interpretation of the Italian Renaissance, and anticipated ideas such as Nietzsche's concept of the 'Ubermensch' in its portrayal of an age of genius.

Up in the Old Hotel	Joseph Mitchell	Paperback,– 1 Jun 1993	5.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	"Saloon-keepers and street preachers, gypsies and steel-walking Mohawks, a bearded lady and a 93-year-old “seafoodetarian” who believes his specialized diet will keep him alive for another two decades. These are among the people that Joseph Mitchell immortalized in his reportage for The New Yorker and in four books—McSorley's Wonderful Saloon, Old Mr. Flood, The Bottom of the Harbor, and Joe Gould's Secret—that are still renowned for their precise, respectful observation, their graveyard humor, and their offhand perfection of style.
 These masterpieces (along with several previously uncollected stories) are available in one volume, which presents an indelible collective portrait of an unsuspected New York and its odder citizens—as depicted by one of the great writers of this or any other time."	Essays (Books)	Humour	435.0

The Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams - Lessons in Living	Randy Pausch	Paperback,– 17 Apr 2008	4.5 out of 5 stars	247 customer reviews	"“The Last Lecture” is a refined and influential book centered around the basic idea of living your life in a cheerful and jubilant manner. If you want to be inspired to conquer your goals and dreams or to fight the odds or by life itself, then your search ends here!
The book revolves around the annual event at the Carnegie Mellon University. The event which is known as “The Last Lecture”, insists on delivering speeches from the University’s faculty. Such lectures are loosely based on the presumptive ground that the professors are going to die shortly and they are giving their last lecture to the students.
This particular book is based on the speech delivered by a professor Randy Pausch. Given the theme of the event, professor Pausch is actually going to deliver his last lecture as he was given just few months to live, being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Professor Pausch delivers a remarkable and inspiring lecture “Achieving Your Childhood Dreams”, while flashing his CT scans in the auditorium amongst the students. The speech was so impressive that it conquered the Internet within no time and was viewed over by millions of users.
Impressed by the response that he got from the lecture, professor Pausch decided to team up with his fellow alumni Jeffrey Zaslow to write a book of the same name “The Last Lecture”. The book also follows the similar premise of living one’s life to the fullest potential as if the given moment is our last one.
There are some short stories given in the book which focus on living life with a clear vision, humour and brilliance in order to achieve one’s goals simultaneously dealing with the challenges and obstacles thrown at us. Also, a person should not focus solely on his or her dreams but help others achieving theirs’ too.
In the book, professor Pausch quotes, “Time is all you have… and you may find one day that you have less than you think.”
The book was a best seller for 85 weeks as per New York Times and 4.5 million plus copies were sold all over the US. The book has been translated into various other languages since. Subsequent to publishing of the book, Randy Pausch presented himself to the US Congress. He stressed on the need for more financial backing into the research of pancreatic cancer.
The book can be directly ordered on Amazon India by the consumer.
About the author:
Randy Pausch taught Computer Science at the Carnegie Mellon University. He worked with other organizations as well like, Adobe, Disney, Electronics and Art and Google. Also he was engaged with a non-profit organization named Alice. He was a co-founder of a professional graduate programme for interactive entertainment, named Entertainment Technology Centre."

The Lost Decade (2008-18): How India's Growth Story Devolved into Growth Without a Story	Puja Mehra	Hardcover,– 18 Apr 2019	3.8 out of 5 stars	9 customer reviews	"Before the global financial meltdown of 2008, India's economy was thriving and its
GDP growth was cruising at an impressive 8.8 per cent. The economic boom impacted
a large section of Indians, even if unequally. With sustained high growth over an extended
period, India could have achieved what economists call a 'take-off' (rapid and
self-sustained GDP growth). The global financial meltdown disrupted this
momentum in 2008.
In the decade that followed, each time the country's economy came close to returning
to that growth trajectory, political events knocked it off course.
In 2019, India's GDP is growing at the rate of 7 per cent, making it the fastest-growing
major economy in the world, but little on the ground suggests that Indians are actually
better off. Economic discontent and insecurity are on the rise, farmers are restive and
land-owning classes are demanding quotas in government jobs. The middle
class is palpably disaffected, the informal economy is struggling and big businesses
are no longer expanding aggressively.
India is not the star it was in 2008 and in effect, the 'India growth story' has devolved
into 'growth without a story'. The Lost Decade tells the story of the slide
and examines the political context in which the Indian economy failed to recover
lost momentum."	Government (Books)	Politics	358.0

In an alternate timeline, World War II never takes place. Instead, a plan is put into effect by Hitler and the Nazi party to drain the Mediterranean Sea. They promise fertile land, millions of jobs and endless energy. New land to be settled. Living space for a crowded continent. All of Europe came together and signed a treaty to realize this new world, it was called `The Atlantropa Articles' Nazism Survives in A New Europe: by promising to bring endless energy through hydro-electricity and employing millions to build the dams, fascism only cements itself as a mainstream ideology. Hitler is seen as a modern Napoleon, one of the greats for his time. Nazism never disappears. The Reich Remains Eternal: Two millennia later, the Reich run the world. Aryans have become a race of their own, out numbering their neighbors and ruling with a messianic passion towards Hitler. Europe has been united under the banner of the swastika. The Sea Is Gone, the Promise Failed: But the plan of a fertile lush land was never realized. The project took decades longer than anticipated. By the time it is completed, what they find is a salty barren world. Now the Mediterranean Sea is a desert basin known only as the Kiln. Southern Europe has been abandoned. This is where Ansel's story begins. A story of discovery, lies and false prophets. The Atlantropa Articles is an astounding science fiction, alternate history tale that will thrill and transport readers with its detailed world and startling intimacy.

Architecture in Medieval India	Monica Juneja	Paperback,– 2008	5.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	From the first half of the nineteenth century, the architectural history of medieval India has been the subject of diverse books, essays and miscellaneous writings. The present book pulls together the most significant of these writings, revealing the impressive array of historical ideas about India's past that has emerged through the study of its monuments. The writings reproduced here are located by the editor within the specific intellectual, political and socio-cultural contexts within which they emerged and were elaborated. By this means, Monica Juneja makes this anthology a major historiographical intervention which traces the colonial emergence and nationalist development of, as well as contemporary advances in, the discipline of architectural history both within India and in relation to art history in the West. Professor Juneja's introduction also examines the intellectual importance of architectural history for all historians, arguing that the study of India's medieval architecture needs to be made integral to every history of conquest, state-building, and the movements of populations and traditions across the subcontinent. She demonstrates that ideas about buildings and their histories have frequently been polemical and instrumental: they have been politically deployed to construct or fabricate a collective past. They have been used to provide symbolic meanings which have helped subjugate or unify heterogeneous communities and nations. In short, the architectural history of India's contentiously misnamed 'Muslim' period is revealed as the site of tensions between Hindus and Muslims, colonialists and nationalists, traditionalists and postmodernists. This book will open the eyes of general readers and students to the politics of interpreting monuments often taken for granted, even as it attempts to resensitise scholars to the vitality and overwhelming relevance of this sometimes neglected area of historiography.

In Ishmael, which received the Turner Tomorrow Fellowship for the best work of fiction offering positive solutions to global problems, Daniel Quinn parses humanity’s origins and its relationship with nature, in search of an answer to this challenging question: How can we save the world from ourselves?
 
Praise for Ishmael

“As suspenseful, inventive, and socially urgent as any fiction or nonfiction you are likely to read this or any other year.”—The Austin Chronicle

“Before we’re halfway through this slim book . . . we’re in [Daniel Quinn’s] grip, we want Ishmael to teach us how to save the planet from ourselves. We want to change our lives.”—The Washington Post

“Arthur Koestler, in an essay in which he wondered whether mankind would go the way of the dinosaur, formulated what he called the Dinosaur’s Prayer: ‘Lord, a little more time!’ Ishmael does its bit to answer that prayer and may just possibly have bought us all a little more time.”—Los Angeles Times"	Religious & Spiritual Fiction (Books)	Humour	413.0
Vikramaditya Veergatha Book 1 - The Guardians of the Halahala	Shatrujeet Nath	Paperback,– 1 Dec 2014	4.5 out of 5 stars	127 customer reviews	"The Price of a Promise Paid in Blood'

The deadly Halahala, the all-devouring poison churned from the depths of the White Lake by the devas and asuras, was swallowed by Shiva to save the universe from extinction.

But was the Halahala truly destroyed?

A small portion still remains – a weapon powerful enough to guarantee victory to whoever possesses it. And both asuras and devas, locked in battle for supremacy, will stop at nothing to claim it.

As the forces of Devaloka and Patala, led by Indra and Shukracharya, plot to possess the Halahala, Shiva turns to mankind to guard it from their murderous clutches. It is now up to Samrat Vikramaditya and his Council of Nine to quell the supernatural hordes – and prevent the universe from tumbling into chaos!

A sweeping tale of honour and courage in the face of infinite danger, greed and deceit, the Guardians of the Halahala is a fantastical journey into a time of myth and legend.

Door-to-door salesman, copywriter, business journalist and assistant editor at the Economic Times, Shatrujeet Nath was all this before he took to writing fiction full-time. He debuted with the Karachi Deception in 2013, followed by the Guardians of the Halahala and the Conspiracy at Meru, the first two books in the Vikramaditya series. At present, he is writing volume three of the series. Shatrujeet lives in Mumbai, but spends much of his time in the fantasy worlds of his stories."	Romance (Books)	Romance	265.0

Homer Kelley's Golfing Machine: The Curious Quest That Solved Golf	Scott Gummer	Paperback,– 4 May 2010	4.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	"The remarkable true story of a lone genius whose quest to unlock the science behind the perfect swing changed golf forever

In 1939, Homer Kelley played golf for the first time and scored 116. Frustrated, he did not play again for six months; when he did he carded a 77. Determined to understand why he was able to shave nearly 40 strokes off his score, Kelley spent three decades of trial and error to unlock the answer and to recapture that one wonderful day when golf was easy and enjoyable. In 1969, Kelley self- published his findings in The Golfing Machine: The Computer Age Approach to Golfing Perfection.

The bestselling instruction books of the day required golfers to conform their swings to the author's ideals, but Homer Kelley configured swings to fit every golfer. He found an enthusiastic disciple in a Seattle teaching pro named Ben Doyle, who in turn found an eager student in 13-year-old prodigy Bobby Clampett. Clampett's initial success in amateur golf shined a bright spotlight on Homer Kelley and The Golfing Machine, but when the young star suffered a painfully public collapse and faltered as a pro, critics were quick to blast Kelley and his complex and controversial ideas. With exclusive access to Homer Kelley's archives, author Scott Gummer paints a fascinating picture of the man behind the machine, the ultimate outsider who changed the game once and for all of us."

The Big Sleep and Other Novels (Penguin Modern Classics)	Raymond Chandler	Paperback,– 3 Feb 2000	4.5 out of 5 stars	13 customer reviews	"Raymond Chandler was America's preeminent writer of detective fiction, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition of The Big Sleep and Other Novels collects three of the best novels to feature his hard-drinking, philosophising PI, Philip Marlowe.
Raymond Chandler created the fast talking, trouble seeking Californian private eye Philip Marlowe for his first great novel The Big Sleep in 1939. Often imitated but never bettered, it is in Marlowe's long shadow that every fictional detective must stand - and under the influence of Raymond Chandler's addictive prose that every crime author must write. Marlowe's entanglement with the Sternwood family - and an attendant cast of colourful underworld figures - is the background to a story reflecting all the tarnished glitter of the great American Dream. The hard-boiled detective's iconic image burns just as brightly in Farewell My Lovely, on the trail of a missing nightclub crooner. And the inimitable Marlowe is able to prove that trouble really is his business in Raymond Chandler's brilliant epitaph, The Long Goodbye.
Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) was born in Chicago. It was during the Depression era that he seriously turned his hand to writing and his first published story appeared in the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1933, followed six years later by his first novel, The Big Sleep, adapted into Howard Hawks' classic 1946 film noir, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.
If you liked The Big Sleep and Other Novels, you might enjoy Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.
'One of the greatest crime writers, who set standards that others still try to attain'
Sunday Times
'Raymond Chandler invented a new way of talking about America, and America has never looked the same to us since.'
Paul Auster, author of The New York Trilogy
'Chandler wrote like a slumming angel and invested the sun-blinded streets of Los Angelos with a romantic presence'

In a Sunburned Country	Bill Bryson	Paperback,– 15 May 2001	4.8 out of 5 stars	13 customer reviews	"Every time Bill Bryson walks out the door, memorable travel literature threatens to break out.

His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller A Walk in the Woods. In A Sunburned Country is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity.

Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book.

Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide."	Writing Guides (Books)	Humour	764.0

The Photographer's Eye Remastered 10th Anniversary: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photographs	Michael Freeman	Paperback,– 15 Jun 2017	3.6 out of 5 stars	6 customer reviews	"With a completely refreshed look to celebrate its tenth anniversary, Michael Freeman's iconic bestseller, The Photographer's Eye, has never looked better.
Design is the single most important factor in creating a successful photograph. The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling composition has always been one of the key skills in making photographs.
Of course, digital photography has brought a new, exciting aspect to design first because the instant feedback from a digital camera allows immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because image-editing tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on the way digital photographers take pictures.

The Photographers Eye shows how anyone can develop an eye for seeing great digital photos. The book explores all the traditional approaches to composition and design, but crucially, it also addresses the new digital technique of shooting in the knowledge that a picture will later be edited, manipulated, or montaged to result in a final image that may be very different from the one seen in the viewfinder."

The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam	Douglas Murray	Paperback,– 14 Jun 2018	4.1 out of 5 stars	7 customer reviews	"The Sunday Times number one bestseller - now including new material by the author, Douglas Murray
Taking into account recent global events since its first explosive publication, The Strange Death of Europe is a highly personal account of a continent and culture caught in the act of suicide. Declining birth-rates, mass immigration and cultivated self-distrust and self-hatred have come together to make Europeans unable to argue for themselves and incapable of resisting their own comprehensive change as a society. This book is not only an analysis of demographic and political realities, but also an eyewitness account of a continent in self-destruct mode. It includes reporting from across the entire continent, from the places where migrants land to the places they end up, from the people who appear to welcome them in to the places which cannot accept them.
Told from this first-hand perspective, and backed with impressive research and evidence, the book addresses the disappointing failure of multiculturalism, Angela Merkel's U-turn on migration, the lack of repatriation and the Western fixation on guilt. Murray travels to Berlin, Paris, Scandinavia, Lampedusa and Greece to uncover the malaise at the very heart of the European culture, and to hear the stories of those who have arrived in Europe from far away. In each chapter he also takes a step back to look at the bigger issues which lie behind a continent's death-wish, answering the question of why anyone, let alone an entire civilisation, would do this to themselves? He ends with two visions of Europe - one hopeful, one pessimistic - which paint a picture of Europe in crisis and offer a choice as to what, if anything, we can do next."

Everything we do involves forecasts about how the future will unfold. Whether buying a new house or changing job, designing a new product or getting married, our decisions are governed by implicit predictions of how things are likely to turn out. The problem is, we're not very good at it.

In a landmark, twenty-year study, Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed that the average expert was only slightly better at predicting the future than a layperson using random guesswork. Tetlock's latest project – an unprecedented, government-funded forecasting tournament involving over a million individual predictions – has since shown that there are, however, some people with real, demonstrable foresight. These are ordinary people, from former ballroom dancers to retired computer programmers, who have an extraordinary ability to predict the future with a degree of accuracy 60% greater than average. They are superforecasters.

In Superforecasting, Tetlock and his co-author Dan Gardner offer a fascinating insight into what we can learn from this elite group. They show the methods used by these superforecasters which enable them to outperform even professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data. And they offer practical advice on how we can all use these methods for our own benefit – whether in business, in international affairs, or in everyday life.


'The techniques and habits of mind set out in this book are a gift to anyone who has to think about what the future might bring. In other words, to everyone.' Economist

'A terrific piece of work that deserves to be widely read . . . Highly recommended.' Independent

'The best thing I have read on predictions . . . Superforecasting is an indispensable guide to this indispensable activity.' The Times"	Action & Adventure (Books)	Action & Adventure	350.0

Hindustani Music: A Tradition in Transition	Deepak Raja	Paperback,– Import, 1 Sep 2015	3.5 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"""Hindustani Music: A tradition in transition"" is a wide-ranging survey of the North Indian tradition of classical music during the post-independence period. Explicitly, this book addresses music lovers of above-average familiarity with Hindustani music, and their curiosity about its inner workings. It is, however, also a valuable reference for scholars and other writers on music.

The book is based on the author's long years of training as a musician, vast experience as an analyst of music, and an observer of the cultural environment.

The book is divided into six parts.

Part I articulates an Indian perspective on important societal, cultural, economic and technological drivers of Hindustani music.

Part II discusses issues pertaining to presentation formats, and the structural and melodic aspects of Hindustani music.

Part III deals with the notion of raga-ness, and the world of ragas.

Part IV presents comprehensive backgrounders on the four major genres of vocal music -- Dhrupad, Khayal, Thumree, and Tappa.

Part V features detailed fact-sheets on eight major melodic instruments of the Hindustani tradition -- Rudra Veena, Sitar, Surbahar, Sarod, Sarangi, Shehnai, Santoor, and the Indian classical (Hawaiian) guitar.

Part VI presents a glossary of words in italics, a list of suggested readings, and an index.

The book makes complex musicological concepts accessible to non-academic readers, and contributes significantly to widening the understanding of contemporary trends in Hindustani music."	Music Books	Arts, Film & Photography	710.51

Adulthood Is a Myth: A Sarah's Scribbles Collection	Sarah Andersen	Paperback,– 8 Mar 2016	4.6 out of 5 stars	70 customer reviews	"Do you love networking to advance your career? Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? Ugh. Please go away.

2016 GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD WINNER FOR GRAPHIC NOVELS AND COMICS!

These casually drawn, perfectly on-point comics by the hugely popular young Brooklyn-based artist Sarah Andersen are for the rest of us. They document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, and dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life. Oh and they are totally not autobiographical. At all.

Adulthood Is a Myth presents many fan favorites plus dozens of all-new comics exclusive to this book. Like the work of fellow Millennial authors Allie Brosh, Grace Helbig, and Gemma Correll, Sarah's frankness on personal issues like body image, self-consciousness, introversion, relationships, and the frequency of bra-washing makes her comics highly relatable and deeply hilarious."

Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat chronicles another segment of the multifarious adventures of this wild child and his faithful, but skeptical, friend. If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy Calvin and Hobbes are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad! Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbe's natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin's sense of security. Calvin's the kid we all wish we'd been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy -- and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers ""Candid Opinions"" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents' authority. ""What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?"" he demands. Calvin and Hobbes manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: ""Eww, mud,"" says Calvin.

It would be a lot for the young boy to handle were it not for his faithful butler, Sebastian.

The Flavours of Nationalism: Recipes for Love, Hate and Friendship	Nandita Haksar	Paperback,– 10 Jun 2018	3.6 out of 5 stars	4 customer reviews	"In this extraordinary book, Nandita Haksar recounts her culinary journey in search of answers to the fundamental questions posed by the recent controversies over food what can we eat, who can we eat with, what foods are forbidden or denigrated and what this says about our country. In this memoir by an unashamed Indian, Haksar writes about how food shaped her awareness of politics, patriarchy, nationalism and socialism, from her childhood during the Nehruvian era onwards. She takes us on a thoughtful journey through India, from her Kashmiri Pandit family settled in Old Delhi and Lucknow, to human-rights activism on behalf of Nagas in Manipur; from grappling with feminist ideals, to considering the impact of a globalized food industry in Goa.
On a wider scale, she explains how our tastes and attitudes to food are shaped by caste, race, gender and class, exposing latent prejudices and bigotry. Haksar explores questions posed by food anthropologists and ecologists and revisits debates between Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi on inter-dining. She also addresses the present controversies over beef-eating, vegetarianism and ideas of Hindu vs. Muslim food, in a milieu where debate is silenced.

With wry accounts of sharing meals with Burmese and Iraqi refugees and arguing about bourgeois vs. proletarian tea in the Naxalite movement, the book also contains memorable recipes from the many people she has eaten with. At heart is her question that if Indians cannot imagine sitting with each other and sharing food with a sense of equality and respect, how then can a national unity be built?"

When Harriet Westaway receives an unexpected letter telling her she’s inherited a substantial bequest from her Cornish grandmother, it seems like the answer to her prayers. She owes money to a loan shark and the threats are getting increasingly aggressive: she needs to get her hands on some cash fast.

There's just one problem - Hal's real grandparents died more than twenty years ago. The letter has been sent to the wrong person. But Hal knows that the cold-reading techniques she’s honed as a seaside fortune teller could help her con her way to getting the money. If anyone has the skills to turn up at a stranger's funeral and claim a bequest they’re not entitled to, it’s her.

Hal makes a choice that will change her life for ever. But once she embarks on her deception, there is no going back. She must keep going or risk losing everything, even her life…

Moonwalk	Michael Jackson	Hardcover,– 13 Oct 2009	4.9 out of 5 stars	52 customer reviews	"In this #1 New York Times bestseller, Michael Jackson tells the story of his life, in his words.

In this intimate and often moving personal account of Michael Jackson’s public and private life, he recalls a childhood that was both harsh and joyful but always formidable. Michael and his brothers played amateur music shows and seamy Chicago strip joints until Motown’s corporate image makers turned the Jackson 5 into worldwide superstars. He talks about the happy prankster days of his youth, traveling with his brothers, and of his sometimes difficult relationships with his family over the years. He speaks candidly about the inspiration behind his music, his mesmerizing dance moves, and the compulsive drive to create that has made him one of the biggest stars in the music business and a legend in his own time.

Jackson also shares his personal feelings about some of his most public friends…friends like Diana Ross, Berry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Paul McCartney, Fred Astaire, Marlon Brando, and Katharine Hepburn. He talks openly about the crushing isolation of his fame, of his first love, of his plastic surgery, and of his wholly exceptional career and the often bizarre and unfair rumors that have surrounded it.

Illustrated with rare photographs from Jackson family albums and Michael’s personal photographic archives, as well as a drawing done by Michael exclusively for this book, Moonwalk is a memorable journey to the very heart and soul of a modern musical genius."

Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys to Creativity	Hugh MacLeod	Hardcover,– 11 Jun 2009	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"When Hugh MacLeod was a struggling young copywriter, living in a YMCA, he started to doodle on the backs of business cards while sitting at a bar. Those cartoons eventually led to a popular blog - gapingvoid.com - and a reputation for pithy insight and humor, in both words and pictures.

MacLeod has opinions on everything from marketing to the meaning of life, but one of his main subjects is creativity. How do new ideas emerge in a cynical, risk-averse world? Where does inspiration come from? What does it take to make a living as a creative person?

Now his first book, Ignore Everyone, expands on his sharpest insights, wittiest cartoons, and most useful advice. A sample:

*Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.

*If your plan depends on you suddenly being ""discovered"" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. Nobody suddenly discovers anything. Things are made slowly and in pain.

*Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.

*The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours. The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.


After learning MacLeod's 40 keys to creativity, you will be ready to unlock your own brilliance and unleash it on the world."	Comics	Comics & Mangas	637.0

The Ramayana	Valmiki	Paperback,– 2016	4.0 out of 5 stars	26 customer reviews	"One of India’s greatest epics, the Ramayana pervades the country’s moral and cultural consciousness. Believed to have been composed by Vālmīki sometime between the eighth and sixth centuries BC, it recounts the tragic and magical tale of Rāma, the wrongfully exiled prince of Ayodhyā, an incarnation of the god Viṣṇu, born to rid the earth of the terrible demon Rāvaṇa.
An idealized heroic tale about the struggle between good and evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honour, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies and destructive ambitions—all this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons.

Set in Oceania, one of the three inter-continental superstate that divided the world among themselves after a global war, Orwell’s masterful critique of the political structures of the time, works itself out through the story of Winston Smith, a man caught in the webs of a dystopian future, and his clandestine love affair with Julia, a young woman he meets during the course of his work for the government.

India - Armenia: So Far Yet So Close	Achal Malhotra	Paperback,– Import, 13 Aug 2018	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"India- Armenia: So Far Yet So Close, written by Achal Malhotra, who served as India's Ambassador to Armenia (2009-12), traces the origins of people to people contacts between Armenia and India to at least 2nd century B.C., and thereafter narrates the story of the glorious past of Armenians in India from medieval India up to India's independence in 1947. He finally highlights the emergence of a new quality of cooperation between the Indian and the Armenian people at the end of the 20th century, which came as a result of the establishment of official ties between the newly independent Republic of Armenia and India on August 31, 1992, and presents his own inspirational vision for the future of this cooperation, based on his insights as a key player in its development.
The readers will be struck with the drastic contrast between the harmonious integration and prosperity of Armenians in Indian society in the past and the apparent absence of Armenians from the landscape of contemporary Indian culture, business and politics. The exodus of the erstwhile prosperous Armenian population from India was nothing but a misread of the situation and a miscalculation of the country's future on the part of Indian-Armenians in the 20th century.
India- Armenia: So Far Yet So Close is intended to trigger interest in its theme, help readers to visualize the distant past and introduce unfamiliar readers with the vibrant history shared between the two ancient people."	International Relations	Politics	200.0

Perfect for fans of Jill Mansell, Debbie Macomber, Nora Roberts and Marie Force.
Who needs mistletoe?
Most people wouldn't think of a bad Santa case as the perfect Christmas gift. Then again, Molly Malone, office manager at Hunt Investigations, isn't most people, and she could really use a distraction from the fantasies she's been having since spending the night with her very secret crush, Lucas Knight. Nothing happened, not that Lucas knows that-but Molly just wants to enjoy being a little naughty for once...
Whiskey and pain meds for almost-healed bullet wounds don't mix. Lucas needs to remember that next time he's shot on the job, which may be sooner rather than later if Molly's brother, Joe, finds out about them. Lucas can't believe he's drawing a blank on his (supposedly) passionate tryst with Molly, who's the hottest, smartest, strongest woman he's ever known. Strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he's been assigned to babysit her on her first case. And hot enough to melt his cold heart this Christmas.

Over the years Jobs gave countless interviews to the media, explaining what he called 'the vision thing'-his unmatched ability to envision, and successfully bring to the marketplace, consumer products that people find simply irresistible. Drawn from more than three decades of media coverage-print, electronic and online-this book serves up the best, most thoughtprovoking insights spoken by Steve Jobs: more than two hundred quotations that are essential reading for everyone who seeks innovative inspiration from the legend himself.

A Very English Scandal: Sex, Lies and a Murder Plot at the Heart of the Establishment	John Preston	Paperback,– 6 Apr 2017	5.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	The shocking true story of the first British politician to stand trial for murder Behind oak-panelled doors in the House of Commons, men with cut-glass accents and gold signet rings are conspiring to murder. It's the late 1960s and homosexuality has only just been legalised, and Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the Liberal party, has a secret he's desperate to hide. As long as Norman Scott, his beautiful, unstable lover is around, Thorpe's brilliant career is at risk. With the help of his fellow politicians, Thorpe schemes, deceives, embezzles - until he can see only one way to silence Scott for good. The trial of Jeremy Thorpe changed our society forever: it was the moment the British public discovered the truth about its political class. Illuminating the darkest secrets of the Establishment, the Thorpe affair revealed such breath-taking deceit and corruption in an entire section of British society that, at the time, hardly anyone dared believe it could be true. A Very English Scandal is an eye-opening tale of how the powerful protect their own, and an extraordinary insight into the forces that shaped modern Britain.

The Devotion Of Suspect X	Keigo Higashino	Paperback,– 2 Feb 2012	4.5 out of 5 stars	215 customer reviews	"Yasuko Hanaoka accidentally kills her ex-husband, when circumstances rose to an unendurable level of ghastly behaviour from him. What follows is an elongated and witty brain-game between the investigator and her accomplice, Ishigami, who aided Yasuko in covering up the murder. The Devotion Of Suspect X is the story about an ingenious plotter, and clever Dr Manabu Yukawa, who helps in solving the case.
Yasuko Hanaoka works in a restaurant. She is divorced, and is a single mother to Misato. Her ex-husband, Togashi, was an abusive man, stalking and extorting money from her. With similar intentions, he showed up at Yasuko’s home, this time threatening to kill her and her daughter if she refused to lend him money. What started from denial, reached to a heated argument, and within a short span of time, turned to a nasty fight. In the spur of the moment, Yasuko killed Togashi. Hearing the commotion in their apartment, Tetsuya Ishigami came into the picture. Ishigami was a middle-aged, single math teacher, who evidently had a growing affection for Yasuko. He offered not only to help her dispose of the corpse, but also to devise a logical plan to cover up the entire incident.
Later, the body was recovered from where it was disposed of. The principal investigator, Kusanagi, was certain of Yasuko’s involvement with the murder but was unable to find sufficient evidence. For a better insight, he summoned the assistance of the ingenious physicist, Dr Manabu Yukawa. Yukawa was a schoolfriend of Ishigami, and he suspected Ishigami. As the story progresses, there are more interesting twists and turns, keeping the readers thrilled and speculating.

We sleep in peace in a world made safer by these supermen and women in white.’—Sourav Ganguly, cricketer

Brother kills brother using the plague bacteria as a murder weapon.

A man is killed in his sleep and his body walled up in the house.

A seemingly docile housewife masterminds a gruesome twin murder…

The Kolkata Police is one of the oldest and most illustrious police forces in the country. In Murder in the City, Supratim Sarkar digs deep into their archives and chooses twelve astonishing cases to recount, bringing investigators, criminals and indeed the city to life in startling detail. Among the cases described in these pages are one where the method of ‘photographic superimposition’ was used for the first time ever in India to identify a body; another, where a single word led the police to a ruthless killer’s hideout; and an extraordinary case of a kidnap and murder that was solved even though the body was never found.

Initially written in Bengali for the Kolkata Police Facebook page and website, these stories went viral and were shared widely when they appeared online for the first time.

Magnificent Delusions: Pakistan, the United States, and an Epic History of Misunderstanding	Husain Haqqani	Paperback,– 3 Feb 2015	4.6 out of 5 stars	32 customer reviews	The relationship between America and Pakistan is based on mutual incomprehension and always has been. Pakistan,to American eyes,has gone from being a quirky irrelevance, to a stabilizing friend, to an essential military ally, to a seedbed of terror. America,to Pakistani eyes,has been a guarantee of security, a coldly distant scold, an enthusiastic military enabler, and is now a threat to national security and a source of humiliation.The countries are not merely at odds. Each believes it can play the other,with sometimes absurd, sometimes tragic, results. The conventional narrative about the war in Afghanistan, for instance, has revolved around the Soviet invasion in 1979. But President Jimmy Carter signed the first authorization to help the Pakistani-backed mujahedeen covertly on July 3,almost six months before the Soviets invaded. Americans were told, and like to believe, that what followed was Charlie Wilson's war of Afghani liberation, with which they remain embroiled to this day. It was not. It was General Zia-ul-Haq's vicious regional power play.Husain Haqqani has a unique insight into Pakistan, his homeland, and America, where he was ambassador and is now a professor at Boston University. His life has mapped the relationship of the two countries and he has found himself often close to the heart of it, sometimes in very confrontational circumstances, and this has allowed him to write the story of a misbegotten diplomatic love affair, here memorably laid bare.

My Feudal Lord	Tehmina Durrani	Mass Market Paperback,– 1 Feb 1996	4.6 out of 5 stars	25 customer reviews	"When a woman with brains and beauty from a wealthy background decides to take her fate into her own hands and challenge the restrictions of a male-oriented, conservative society, the consequences can be devastating.

Born into one of Pakistan's most influential families, Tehmina Durrani was raised in the privileged milieu of Lahore high society, and educated at the same school as Benazir Bhutto. Like all women of her rank, she was expected to marry a prosperous Muslim from a respectable family, bear him many children, and lead a sheltered life of air-conditioned leisure. When she married Mustafa Khar, one of Pakistan's most eminent political figures, she continued to move in the best circles, and learned to keep up the public façade as a glamorous, cultivated wife, and mother of four children.

In private, however, the story-book romance of the most talked-about couple in Pakistan rapidly turned sour. Mustafa Khar became violently possessive and pathologically jealous, and succeeded in cutting his wife off from the outside world. For the course of the fourteen-year marriage, she suffered alone, in silence.

When Tehmina decided to rebel, the price she paid was extremely high: as a Muslim woman seeking a divorce, she signed away all financial support, lost the custody of her four children, and found herself alienated from her friends and disowned by her parents.

Following the divorce, she felt she had to tell her story. When Pakistan publishers balked at the controversial nature of her manuscript, she published it herself. The book was a bombshell and shook Pakistani society to its foundations. Her at last was someone who had succeeding in reconciling her faith in Islam with her ardent belief in women's rights. Tehmina's story, adapted now for western readers, provides extraordinary insights into the vulnerable position of women caught in the complex web of Muslim society."

-----
When Billy, a troubled young man, comes to private eye Cormoran Strike's office to ask for his help investigating a crime he thinks he witnessed as a child, Strike is left deeply unsettled. While Billy is obviously mentally distressed, and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts from his office in a panic.
Trying to get to the bottom of Billy's story, Strike and Robin Ellacott - once his assistant, now a partner in the agency - set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful but sinister manor house deep in the countryside.
And during this labyrinthine investigation, Strike's own life is far from straightforward: his newfound fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it ever has been - Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their personal relationship is much, much more tricky than that . . .
The most epic Robert Galbraith novel yet, LETHAL WHITE is both a gripping mystery and a page-turning next instalment in the ongoing story of Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott.

Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps	Allan Pease, Barbara Pease	Paperback,– 1 Sep 2001	4.4 out of 5 stars	27 customer reviews	Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps, an international bestseller, is a guide for the readers to understand more about the opposite sex. The authors have travelled extensively and carried out a great deal of research, to put together their highly controversial book on the differences between the way women and men think. Through the course of this book, the authors tackle several common questions about men - why they can't multitask, should never lie to a woman, crave erotic images and offer solutions but disregard advice. This book observes gender roles from prehistoric times, when men adopted the role of being a hunter, with women being nest-keepers. The authors explain how these roles developed with time and surfaced in modern-day situations. They also throw light on a number of psychological and sociological studies, which prove their thesis correct. The authors also throw light on certain inherent, biological differences in women and men that may prove impossible to bridge. Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps is a hilarious, yet illuminating guide on how the opposite sex thinks.	Gender Studies	Humour	339.0
The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man: How America really took over the world	John Perkins	Paperback,– Import, 5 Jul 2018	4.5 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"***THE WORD OF MOUTH INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER NOW UPDATED WITH 15 EXPLOSIVE NEW CHAPTERS***

False economics. Threats, bribes, extortion. Debt, deception, coups, assassinations and unbridled military power. These are the tools used by the ‘corporatocracy’ – a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments and rich and powerful individuals – to ensure that they retain and expand their wealth and influence, growing richer and richer as the poor become poorer.

In his original, post 9/11 book, John Perkins revealed how he was recruited as an economic hit man in the 1970s, and exposed the corrupt methods American corporations use to spread their influence in the developing world, cheating countries out of trillions of dollars. In this new, extensively updated edition he lays bare the latest, terrifying evolution of the economic hit man, and how the system has become even more entrenched and powerful than ever before.

In New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, John Perkins provides fresh and chilling evidence of how the corporatocracy has grown its influence to every corner of the globe, making us all unwitting slaves to their regime. But he also provides advice on how we can end our unconscious support of the system and its self-serving, lethal economy.

""Perkins has, once again, made a substantial contribution to a world that needs whistle-blowers to open its eyes to the true sources of political, social, and economic power"" - Yanis Varoufakis

Rhymes of Whimsy - The Complete Abol Tabol: Translated Into Rhyme-Accurate English, with Investigative Analysis of Hidden Satire.	Niladri Roy	Hardcover,– 17 Apr 2017	5.0 out of 5 stars	3 customer reviews	"Only very rarely comes along a book that both delights the senses and stimulates the intellect at the same time. This first and only complete translation of Abol Tabol in more than 100 years manages to do both with consummate ease.
With amazingly rhyme-accurate rendering that reads as if the poems had been penned in the English language to begin with, this translation preserves every single rollicking rhyme and the exact same cadences as in the originals. Each translated poem is one hundred percent line-accurate and evokes immediate nostalgia of the original in both rhyme and rhythm.
Abol Tabol is, in fact, cleverly disguised socio-political satire, written to mock the state of society and administration of early 20th century colonial India. The book provides groundbreaking analysis, linking the poems to specific historical events and uncovering the targeted satire hidden in many of the poems. It answers questions like: Who is Katth Buro? Which scandal in English parliament is the poem Gondho Bichar about? Which Bengal-school painting is mocked in Bhooturey Khela? Which three Indian statesmen were the Ahlaadi in real life?
With a total of more than 250 pages, this is a book in two parts: the first comprises the translated poems and more than 40 illustrations. The second contains investigative analysis and some never-before-published commentary on the symbolism and hidden meanings woven skillfully into the poems. The analysis is beautifully clear, concise and logical, and cites more than 45 separate bibliographical references.
This book turns conventional wisdom about Sukumar Ray's Abol Tabol on its head, and irrevocably changes the understanding of this timeless work forever. A must-read for enthusiasts of humorous nonsense verse, as well as for academicians and students engaged in comparative literature and South Asian literature studies."	Humour (Books)	Humour	600.0

In this updated edition of the #1 New York Times bestseller, Gretchen Rubin shares her wisdom to leading—and living—a more enriched, fulfilling, and happier life “This is the rare book that will make you both smile and think—often on the same page.” —Daniel H. Pink, author...

Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. “The days are long, but the years are short,” she realized. ""Time is passing, and I’m not focusing enough on the things that really matter.” In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project. In this lively and compelling account-now updated with new material by the author—Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference."

Getting a Grip: On My Game, My Body, My Mind...My Self	Monica Seles	Hardcover,– Import, 25 May 2009	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	At the age of sixteen, Monica Seles crashed on to the world tennis scene by becoming the youngest winner in French Open History. For three years, she dominated the tennis circuit, racking up eight Grand Slam titles, winning three back-to-back French Open titles. At post-match conferences she charmed the media with her trademark giggle. In January 1993, Seles defeated Steffi Graf in the Australian Women's Open and in April of that year, while playing a quarter-final in Hamburg, a boning knife was plunged between her shoulder blades by a Graff fan. Everything changed. The incident shocked the tennis world. Seles' injuries healed, but Seles did not. Now, in this compelling book she tells us in her own words what followed - years of seclusion, the fog of despair, binge eating, dealing with criticism about her weight from a brutal press, losing her father-coach to cancer and never regaining her dominance on court despite getting in to the top 10. After years battling to regain fitness and tennis glory, an excruciating injury forced Monica to take time off from tennis in 2003 and she embarked on her own journey. She abandoned the arduous workouts and punitive diets, and slowly uncovered the painful emotions behind years of tumultuous feelings. This is a human and inspiring story of determination, amazing talent and touching vulnerability, that Seles hopes will motivate and inspire others to find happiness in their own lives. Monica Seles is a former No 1 professional tennis player who became the youngest-ever champion at the French Open in 1990 and went on to win nine Grand Slam singles titles. In 2007, she was appointed goodwill ambassador for the UN's Global Sports for Peace and Development Initiative.	Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)	Sports	1476.79

A “towering, swash-buckling thrill of a book” (Newsweek), hailed as Chabon’s “magnum opus” (The New York Review of Books), The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a triumph of originality, imagination, and storytelling, an exuberant, irresistible novel that begins in New York City in 1939. A young escape artist and budding magician named Joe Kavalier arrives on the doorstep of his cousin, Sammy Clay. While the long shadow of Hitler falls across Europe, America is happily in thrall to the Golden Age of comic books, and in a distant corner of Brooklyn, Sammy is looking for a way to cash in on the craze. He finds the ideal partner in the aloof, artistically gifted Joe, and together they embark on an adventure that takes them deep into the heart of Manhattan, and the heart of old-fashioned American ambition. From the shared fears, dreams, and desires of two teenage boys, they spin comic book tales of the heroic, fascist-fighting Escapist and the beautiful, mysterious Luna Moth, otherworldly mistress of the night. Climbing from the streets of Brooklyn to the top of the Empire State Building, Joe and Sammy carve out lives, and careers, as vivid as cyan and magenta ink. Spanning continents and eras, this superb book by one of America’s finest writers remains one of the defining novels of our modern American age.

The Doctor and the Saint: The Ambedkar–Gandhi Debate: Caste, Race, and Annihilation of Caste	Arundhati Roy	Paperback,– 22 Apr 2019	3.9 out of 5 stars	12 customer reviews	"To best understand and address the inequality in India today, Arundhati Roy insists we must examine both the political development and influence of M.K. Gandhi and why B.R. Ambedkar's brilliant challenge to his near-divine status was suppressed by India's elite. In Roy's analysis, we see that Ambedkar's fight for justice was systematically sidelined in favor of policies that reinforced caste, resulting in the current nation of India: independent of British rule, globally powerful, and marked to this day by the caste system.
This book situates Ambedkar's arguments in their vital historical context-namely, as an extended public political debate with Mohandas Gandhi. 'For more than half a century-throughout his adult life-[Gandhi's] pronouncements on the inherent qualities of black Africans, untouchables and the laboring classes remained consistently insulting,' writes Roy. 'His refusal to allow working-class people and untouchables to create their own political organizations and elect their own representatives remained consistent too.'
In The Doctor and the Saint, Roy exposes some uncomfortable, controversial, and even surprising truths about the political thought and career of India's most famous and most revered figure. In doing so she makes the case for why Ambedkar's revolutionary intellectual achievements must be resurrected, not only in India but throughout the world."

Quantum Healing (Revised and Updated): Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine	Deepak Chopra M.D.	Paperback,– 17 Nov 2015	2.6 out of 5 stars	3 customer reviews	"THE LANDMARK BESTSELLER—NOW COMPLETELY REVISED AND UPDATED
 
More than twenty-five years ago, Quantum Healing helped transform Deepak Chopra into a cultural phenomenon. Now Dr. Chopra, hailed by Time as “the poet-prophet of alternative medicine,” returns to this groundbreaking exploration of consciousness and the power of mindfulness, adding the latest scientific research as well as expanded thoughts on the connection between body and mind.
 
Inspired by the unexplained recovery of patients in his own practice who had been given just a few months to live, Dr. Chopra began his search for answers. After returning to his native India to explore humanity’s most ancient healing tradition, Ayurveda, he combined those insights with Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics. What he discovered—a “network of intelligence” in the human body with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, even aging itself—forms the basis of Quantum Healing. In this new edition, Dr. Chopra once again offers a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.
 
Praise for Quantum Healing
 
“Quantum Healing didn’t set out to cure cancer or Alzheimer’s or any other intractable disease. It set out to see the human body, and human existence in general, through wiser eyes. As a scientist I’m passionate about genes and the brain; as a person I’m totally fascinated by the origins of consciousness. Quantum Healing galvanized my intuition that these areas do not have to be separated.”—Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, from the new foreword
 
“Deepak Chopra illuminates our true innate capacity for healing, growth, and evolution. With the wisdom of an experienced doctor, girded by science, he guides us to reclaim our natural power towards thriving. Chopra’s work is paradigm-changing for medicine and helpful beyond measure for every human being seeking to evolve, flourish, and know our true nature.”—Lisa Miller, Ph.D., author of The Spiritual Child and director of clinical psychology, Teachers College, Columbia University"	Mental & Spiritual Healing	Action & Adventure	530.44
Don'T Kill Him!: The Story Of My Life With Bhagwan Rajneesh	Ma Anand Sheela	Paperback,– 1 Jan 2013	3.7 out of 5 stars	33 customer reviews	"As His personal secretary between 1981 and 1985, and the second-in-command of His organization, Ma Anand Sheela enjoyed an enviably close relationship with Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Bhagwan called upon her when He wanted to discuss personal issues, crucial administrative matters, run minor errands, and to even place an order for a new Rolls-Royce. Ma Sheela was His confidante, His closest aide, the person He trusted more than anyone else. She ruled the entire commune under His guidance . . . until differences crept up. What followed next, soon became part of Bhagwans infamous history, as after years of loyal service, Ma Sheela resigned from her position, left the commune, and fled to Europe with fellow members. An infuriated Rajneesh wasted no time in accusing her of planning a bio-terror attack, conspiring to murder important public officials, and running away with fifty-five million dollars. Ma Sheela pled guilty to some of the charges in court and spent thirty-nine months in prison.
Now, almost two decades later, Ma Sheela, still in love with Bhagwan and His teachings, finally tells her side of the story, claiming that the truth was very different, and sheds light on that part of Bhagwans life which has so far been shrouded in a cover of secrecy and darkness."

Feluda @ 50	Boria Majumdar	Paperback,– 26 Jan 2016	4.0 out of 5 stars	14 customer reviews	In 1965, Satyajit Ray, drawing from the detective tradition made popular by characters such as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, created a character who would go on to influence Bengalis of an entire generation: Feluda. And when Soumitra Chatterjee played the dapper detective in the film Sonar Kella, a cult was born. Fifty years later, the cult endures. Every new Feluda film has the box office in a tizzy. Feluda@50 seeks to explore the phenomenon. What makes Feluda tick? What is it that we love about this man? Why is it that every Feluda film continues to run to packed houses for weeks and months on end in an otherwise struggling Bengali film industry? What is the way forward for the franchise in the years to come? What role do Feluda's sidekicks, Topshe and Lalmohan-babu, play? The book also delves deep into Ray's motivations for keeping Feluda cocooned from contemporary politics and never allowing him to have a love interest. Also including in-depth interviews with the three stars who have played Feluda onscreen, this is the quintessential fan tribute and a celebration of Feluda on the occasion of the sleuths fiftieth anniversary.

Dracula (Wordsworth Classics)	Bram Stoker, Dr. David Rogers, Dr. Keith Carabine	Paperback,– 5 Apr 1993	5.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	Introduction and Notes by Dr David Rogers, Kingston University. 'There he lay looking as if youth had been half-renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey, the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst the swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood; he lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.' Thus Bram Stoker, one of the greatest exponents of the supernatural narrative, describes the demonic subject of his chilling masterpiece Dracula, a truly iconic and unsettling tale of vampirism.

American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company	Bryce G. Hoffman	Paperback,– 5 Feb 2013	4.5 out of 5 stars	19 customer reviews	"The inside story of the epic turnaround of Ford Motor Company under the leadership of CEO Alan Mulally.
 
At the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself.

Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys­functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family—America’s last great industrial dynasty—could hold on to their company.
 
Mulally and his team pulled off one of the great­est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. American Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround.

In one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meet­ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry.
 
Hoffman was granted unprecedented access to Ford’s top executives and top-secret company documents. He spent countless hours with Alan Mulally, Bill Ford, the Ford family, former executives, labor leaders, and company directors. In the bestselling tradition of Too Big to Fail and The Big Short, American Icon is narrative nonfiction at its vivid and colorful best."

The Jew is Not My Enemy: Unveiling the Myths that Fuel Muslim Anti-Semitism	Tarek Fatah	Paperback,– 6 Dec 2011	4.1 out of 5 stars	10 customer reviews	"A liberal Muslim and critically acclaimed author explores the historical, political, and theological basis for centuries of Muslim animosity towards Jews, debunking long-held myths and tracing a history of hate and its impact today.

More than nine years after 9/11 and 60 years after the creation of the state of Israel, the world is no closer to solving, let alone understanding, the psychological and political divide between Jews and Muslims. While countless books have been written on the subject of terrorism, political Islam, and jihad, barely a handful address the theological and historical basis of the Jew—Muslim divide. Following the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008, in which Pakistani jihadis sought out and murdered the members of a local Jewish centre, Tarek Fatah began an in-depth investigation of the historical basis for the crime.

In this provocative new book, Fatah uses extensive research to trace how literature from as early as the seventh century has fueled the hatred of Jews by Muslims. Fatah debunks the anti-Jewish writings of the Hadith literature, takes apart the Arab supremacist doctrines that lend fuel to the fire, and reinterprets supposed anti-Jewish passages in the Quran. In doing so he argues that hating Jews is against the essence of the Islamic spirit and suggests what needs to be done to eliminate the agonizing friction between the two communities."

Mrs Funnybones	Twinkle Khanna	Paperback,– 18 Aug 2015	4.1 out of 5 stars	1,558 customer reviews	"Mrs Funnybones unravelled
Almost everyone has a similar family story in India and this is what Mrs Funnybones or rather Twinkle Khanna pokes fun at. The husband who’s the “man of the house”, the crazy mothers in law, friends and of course the constant jibes at her weight make it an intriguing read. Everything comes together to leave the reader cackling away in laughter.
Dwell deeper because this book will certainly make you think
The tag line of the book, 'She’s just like and a lot like me” coupled with the celebrity author might make one wonder, how can one compare a normal Indian household life with the glamorous life of someone like Twinkle Khanna. But that is the beauty of this book. It is not entirely an autobiography of the author, nor is it the typical tell all that celebrities so often write. This is a book of a woman who is a mother of two, an ordinary version of the star and someone who finds humour in the everyday situations that women in India face every day. That is what makes the book relatable even though it has been written by someone who’s the daughter of celebrities and married to one. Through her own anecdotes and by drawing parallels between a star’s life and a normal life, she has managed to write a book which is funny yet at the same time it forces you to think and comment on the situation. Mrs Funnybones is a comical take on the life of modern Indian women.
Mrs Funnybones Herself: About the Author

The Valley of Flowers: An Adventure in the Upper Himalaya	Frank S. Smythe	Paperback,– 14 Sep 2015	4.5 out of 5 stars	18 customer reviews	In 1931, a party of British mountaineers—including Frank S. Smythe—on their way back from a successful ascent of Mount Kamet, were looking for shelter from inclement weather in the wilderness above Joshimath in present-day Uttarakhand when they came upon the lush and colourful Bhyundar Valley, the Valley of Flowers. In the monsoon of 1937, Smythe returned to the Valley with four Tibetans from Darjeeling—his climbing partners and factotums—provisions, and six weeks of leisure. On this adventure, Smythe extensively explored the Valley, identifying and collecting flowers and seeds from among the wealth of plant life. He and his friends also scaled the Nilgiri Parbat and the Mana Peak and were defeated by Mount Rataban. Beset by the rains, the party was nearly always soggy and, once, an Abominable Snowman gave them the fright of their lives. Yet, these were but minor prices to pay for the privilege of witnessing the Himalaya in its infinite variety and for a great deal of time usefully spent ruminating on the joys of idleness. The very best kind of nature and adventure writing, which vividly captures the exuberance of wide open vistas as well as the opportunities for solitude and introspection they provide, The Valley of Flowers is a book to read, and to keep dipping into.

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal: The Lives and Careers of Two Tennis Legends	Sebastián Fest	Hardcover,– 23 Aug 2016	1.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	"Since 2004, two names have dominated men's tennis: Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. Each player is legendary in his own right. The Spanish Nadal is the winner of fourteen Grand Slam titles, including five consecutive French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014, and is the only player ever to win a Grand Slam for ten straight years. Federer, from Switzerland, has spent over three hundred weeks of his career ranked as the number-one player in the world and has won seventeen Grand Slam titles and two Olympic medals. But neither player's career would have been nearly as successful without the decade-long rivalry that pushed them to excel to the peak of tennis excellence.

Nadal and Federer have met thirty-four times over the course of their careers, and have shared the distinction of being ranked the two best players in the world for an astounding six years in a row from 2005 to 2009. In Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, international sports journalist Sebastian Fest uses information gleaned from his numerous interviews with both players over the last decade to narrate the rivalry, and its impact not only on the players, but on the sport itself. Documenting their respective wins and losses, hopes and disappointments, and their relationship with their rival, Fest formulates a unique biography of two of the greatest players of tennis.

Perspective Made Easy (Dover Art Instruction)	Ernest Norling	Paperback,– 19 Jan 1999	4.1 out of 5 stars	15 customer reviews	"Perspective, the author tells us, is easy; yet surprisingly few artists are aware of the simple rules that make it so. This easy-to-follow book — the first devoted entirely to clarifying the laws of perspective — remedies the situation. In it, the author uses over 250 simple line drawings to illustrate the concepts involved.
Beginning with clear, concise, immediately applicable discussions of the horizon, vanishing point, and the crucial relationship of eye level to perspective drawing, you'll learn how to place figures and objects in a drawing, depict interiors, create shade and shadows, and achieve all the other elements necessary for a successful perspective drawing. By repeatedly stressing important points, Mr. Norling teaches you to make them second-nature. Moreover, his approach is so simple and direct that no matter how little raw talent or experience you have, you will soon be able to apply these techniques almost instinctively.
Mastery of perspective is a basic skill every artist must have. This simple, nontechnical guide will enable you to master its essentials in a relatively short time. Clear and concise, this book is an essential addition to any artist's bookshelf."	Handicrafts, Decorative Arts & Crafts (Books)	Arts, Film & Photography	482.0

Through the communication of big ideas and the publication of accessible Economic Surveys, he gained a reputation as an innovator. Through honest pronouncements that avoided spin, he became a figure of public trust. What does it entail to serve at the helm of the world's fastest-growing economy, where decision-making affects a population of more than a billion people?
In Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, Arvind Subramanian provides an inside account of his rollercoaster journey as the chief economic advisor to the Government of India from 2014-18, succeeding Raghuram Rajan as captain of the ship. With an illustrious cast of characters, Subramanian's part-memoir, part-analytical writings candidly reveal the numerous triumphs and challenges of policymaking at the zenith, while appraising India's economic potential, health and future through comprehensive research and original hypotheses.
Charged with the task to restructure an insecure and fragile economy, Subramanian's trusteeship has seen the country through one of the most hotly contested and turbulent periods of economic governance and policymaking in recent decades-from the controversial recall of 85 per cent of circulated currency during demonetization to a complete overhaul in taxation with the introduction of the GST. Subramanian also addresses the overleveraging of public-sector banks, the fraught links between the state and private sector ('stigmatized capitalism'), the changing relationship between the state and the individual, and the ever-pervasive, life-threatening issues surrounding climate change.
Recognized as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers according to Foreign Policy magazine, Arvind Subramanian's Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy is a deep-dive into the man, the moments, the measures and the means."	Economics Textbooks	Politics	402.0

Auel opens the door of a time long past to reveal an age of wonder and danger at the dawn of the modern human race. With all the consummate storytelling artistry and vivid authenticity she brought to The Clan of the Cave Bear and its sequel, The Valley of Horses, Jean M. Auel continues the breathtaking epic journey of the woman called Ayla.

Riding Whinney with Jondalar, the man she loves, and followed by the mare’s colt, Ayla ventures into the land of the Mamutoi--The Mammoth Hunters.

Bringing back the single pup of a lone wolf she has killed, Ayla shows the way she tames animals.

She finds women friends and painful memories of the Clan she left behind, and meets Ranec, the dark-skinned, magnetic master carver of ivory, whom she cannot refuse--inciting Jondalar to a fierce jealousy that he tries to control by avoiding her. Unfamiliar with the ways of the Others, Ayla misunderstands, and thinking Jondalar no longer loves her, she turns more to Ranec. Throughout the icy winter the tension mounts, but warming weather will bring the great mammoth hunt and the mating rituals of the Summer Meeting, when Ayla must choose to remain with Ranec and the Mamutoi, or to follow Jondalar on a long journey into an unknown future."

Speaking of Films	Satyajit Ray	Paperback,– 29 Jul 2005	4.4 out of 5 stars	30 customer reviews	India’s greatest film-maker on the art and craft of films. Exactly fifty years ago, in 1955, the release of Pather Panchali heralded the arrival of a master in the world of cinema. Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world’s finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India’s most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray’s most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important developments in cinema like the advent of sound and color. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him—the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray’s writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.

The Buddha Box Set	Osamu Tezuka	Paperback,– Box set, 15 Jun 2014	4.3 out of 5 stars	34 customer reviews	"The classic eight volume graphic novel series from the godfather of the genre an irreverent and humourous rendition of the life and times of Buddha is now available in Box Set. Originated in the 1970s, Buddha is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha. Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas, with an emphasis on action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering and ordering one's life sensibly. Furthermore, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour.
The Box Set includes
Buddha: Kapilvastu - Vol. 1
Buddha: The Four Encounters - Vol. 2
Buddha: Devadatta - Vol. 3
Buddha: The Forest of Uruvela - Vol. 4

The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How.	Daniel Coyle	Paperback,– Import, 3 Mar 2014	4.4 out of 5 stars	32 customer reviews	"What is the secret of talent? How do we unlock it? This groundbreaking work provides readers with tools they can use to maximize potential in themselves and others.

Whether you’re coaching soccer or teaching a child to play the piano, writing a novel or trying to improve your golf swing, this revolutionary book shows you how to grow talent by tapping into a newly discovered brain mechanism.
Drawing on cutting-edge neurology and firsthand research gathered on journeys to nine of the world’s talent hotbeds—from the baseball fields of the Caribbean to a classical-music academy in upstate New York—Coyle identifies the three key elements that will allow you to develop your gifts and optimize your performance in sports, art, music, math, or just about anything.
• Deep Practice Everyone knows that practice is a key to success. What everyone doesn’t know is that specific kinds of practice can increase skill up to ten times faster than conventional practice.
• Ignition We all need a little motivation to get started. But what separates truly high achievers from the rest of the pack? A higher level of commitment—call it passion—born out of our deepest unconscious desires and triggered by certain primal cues. Understanding how these signals work can help you ignite passion and catalyze skill development.
• Master Coaching What are the secrets of the world’s most effective teachers, trainers, and coaches? Discover the four virtues that enable these “talent whisperers” to fuel passion, inspire deep practice, and bring out the best in their students.
These three elements work together within your brain to form myelin, a microscopic neural substance that adds vast amounts of speed and accuracy to your movements and thoughts. Scientists have discovered that myelin might just be the holy grail: the foundation of all forms of greatness, from Michelangelo’s to Michael Jordan’s. The good news about myelin is that it isn’t fixed at birth; to the contrary, it grows, and like anything that grows, it can be cultivated and nourished.
Combining revelatory analysis with illuminating examples of regular people who have achieved greatness, this book will not only change the way you think about talent, but equip you to reach your own highest potential."	Sports Training & Coaching (Books)	Sports	247.0

How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential, what defines a person’s limits? From running a two-hour marathon to summiting mount Everest, we’re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.

He presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology.

An Elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today, showing us how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance and get the most out of their bodies."

It weaves together tales of international intrigue, cyber espionage and superpower rivalry. After U.S. Russia relations soured, as Vladimir Putin moved to reassert Russian strength on the global stage, Moscow trained its best hackers on U.S. political targets and exploited WikiLeaks to disseminate information that could affect the 2016 campaign.
The Russians were wildly successful and the great break-in of 2016 was no “third rate burglary.” It was far more sophisticated and sinister a brazen act of political espionage designed to interfere with the election. At the end of the day, Trump, the candidate who pursued business deals with Russia, won and millions of Americans were left wondering what the hell happened
This gripping and behind-the-scenes story of high-tech spying and political crisis will take the reader inside the White House, the Kremlin, the U.S. intelligence community, the Trump and Clinton campaigns and both political parties.

Game Changer	Shahid Afridi	Hardcover,– 29 Apr 2019	3.7 out of 5 stars	24 customer reviews	Game Changer is the riveting memoir of Shahid Afridi, one of modern cricket's most controversial and accomplished practitioners. In 1996, as a teenager, Afridi shot to fame after hammering the fastest ODI century at the time. One of the world's greatest all-rounders, today, he holds the distinction of having hit the most number of sixes in the history of ODI cricket scooping the most wickets in T20s and winning the most player-of-the match awards in the same format. From his humble beginnings in the mountains of Pakistan's unruly northwest to the mean streets of Karachi and the county parks of southern England, Afridi tells his life story just the way he bats - instinctively, candidly and with no holds barred. In a career as unpredictable as his leg-break googlies and 'boom-boom' power hitting, Afridi has been many things - the lost kid focused on pulling his parents out of poverty, the desperate captain trying not to snitch on his corrupt teammates, the gallant Pashtun centurion staring down a hostile Indian crowd, and the bad boy at the centre of a ball-tampering scandal. In Game Changer, he sets the record straight once and for all. A must-read not only for his legion of fans across the world but also for those interested in cricket and Pakistan's future.

India: From Midnight to the Millennium	Shashi Tharoor	Paperback,– 31 Jul 2012	4.3 out of 5 stars	50 customer reviews	"Well-balanced, informative and highly readable""-Amartya Sen India: From Midnight to the Millennium and Beyond is an eloquent argument for the importance of India to the future of the industrialized world. Shashi Tharoor shows compellingly that India stands at the intersection of the most significant questions facing the world today. If democracy leads to inefficient political infighting, should it be sacrificed in the interest of economic well-being? Does religious fundamentalism provide a way for countries in the developing world to assert their identity in the face of Western hegemony, or is there a case for pluralism and diversity amid cultural and religious traditions? Does the entry of Western consumer goods threaten a country's economic self-sufficiency, and is protectionism the only guarantee of independence? The answers to such questions will determine what the nature of our world is in the twenty-first century. And since Indians account for almost one-sixth of the world's population today, their choices will resonate throughout the globe. Shashi Tharoor deals with this vast theme in a work of remarkable depth and startling originality, combining elements of political scholarship, personal reflection, memoir, fiction, and polemic, all illuminated in vivid and compelling prose."

Man's Search for Meaning	Viktor E Frankl	Paperback,– 7 Feb 2008	4.3 out of 5 stars	804 customer reviews	"Man's Search for Meaning was first published in 1946. Victor Frankl was a leading psychologist in Vienna when he was arrested for being a Jew during the Nazi regime. He survived holocaust and used his experiences to write this book. He propounded the theory that it is Man's constant search for meaning that allows him to survive even the most brutal, the most degrading situations in his life.
He said there are only two races in the world, the decent and indecent. They will maintain their innate beliefs, no matter which side they are on. The decent ones will try to help the fellow human beings and the indecent ones will be selfish and serve themselves at the cost to the others.
Frankl's views were different from those of the leading psychologist of his times, Freud and Adler. His research was intensely personal and unique. His findings of human behaviour were based on the most extenuating circumstances that humans face. He suffered holocaust along with several other inmates and he observed their behaviour closely. He found that those with a capability to focus on love were the ones that survived. He based this observation on a long walk he was forced into by his captors. His companion spoke about his wife. This made Frankl think about his wife and the thought of her took his mind away from his current agony of being hit with rifle butts by his captors for dawdling.
The book has been listed as one of the 10 most influential books. It has a message of hope that has continued to inspire readers down the years.
About the author:
Victor Emile Frankl was a successful neurologist and psychologist dedicated to saving people from suicidal depression. He was born into a Jewish family because of which he was prosecuted by the Nazi regime after they took over Austria. He was banished to Nazi Theresienstadt Ghetto along with his family in 1942. He continued to practice as a Psychologist there and continued to treat people with depression. He was sent to Auschwitz in 1944 where he spent several months before they were liberated in 1945. He watched his family die in concentration camps.
He used his experiences as a holocaust survivor in his bestselling book Man's search for meaning. He worked at the Vienna Polyclinic for Neurology. He lectured extensively and conducted seminars all over the world. He lectured at the University of Vienna and Harvard. He wrote 39 books which were translated in several languages. He died of heart failure in 1997."	Holocaust	Politics	150.0

Everybody Lies: The New York Times Bestseller	Seth Stephens-Davidowitz	Paperback,– 18 Apr 2018	4.3 out of 5 stars	27 customer reviews	"THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER
AN ECONOMIST BOOK OF THE YEAR 2017
Insightful, surprising and with ground-breaking revelations about our society, Everybody Lies exposes the secrets embedded in our internet searches, with a foreword by bestselling author Steven Pinker
Everybody lies, to friends, lovers, doctors, pollsters - and to themselves. In Internet searches, however, people confess their secrets - about sexless marriages, mental health problems, even racist views. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an economist and former Google data scientist, shows that this could just be the most important dataset ever collected.
This huge database of secrets - unprecedented in human history - offers astonishing, even revolutionary, insights into humankind. Anxiety, for instance, does not increase after a terrorist attack. Crime levels drop when a violent film is released. And racist searches are no higher in Republican areas than in Democrat ones.
Stephens-Davidowitz reveals information we can use to change our culture, and the questions we're afraid to ask that might be essential to our health - both emotional and physical. Insightful, funny, and always surprising, Everybody Lies exposes the biases and secrets embedded deeply within us, at a time when things are harder to predict than ever."

Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products	Nir Eyal	Hardcover,– 6 Nov 2014	4.7 out of 5 stars	165 customer reviews	"The book, 'Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products’ is an effective book for people who want to learn the art of selling products. This book derives strategies from stories of products that have made it big in their respective industries whilst citing the reasons for their success. Filled with critical insights, the usage of examples and anecdotes makes the content engaging and refreshing. The book is authored by Nir Eyal and was published by Portfolio Penguin publication in 2014. This book has received positive responses across the world and was in the list of Wall Street Journal business 'best selling' books. Plus, it won the award of 'best marketing book of the year' given by 1800CEOREAD.
The market is full of products that have similar qualities. However, very few of these products grow successful over the years.
What makes these products successful? This book tries to analyze this question and looks to find the answer using definitive research and a wide range of methodologies. This book also talks about the 'Hook Model’ that involves a four step process focusing on consumer behaviour. This model talks about the reasons why few products catch our attention amongst an extensive range and the various brand strategies which work. Then, there is the concept of 'hook cycles’ which deals with bringing people back to the products again and again even without the use of regular advertising. After a careful analysis, the author gives various techniques which enable the readers to create a system which allows them to form these hook cycles. The basic idea of these systems is to reach the heart of consumers and understand their likes and dislikes.

Becoming	Michelle Obama	Hardcover,– Import, 13 Nov 2018	4.5 out of 5 stars	225 customer reviews	"An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States, now a No.1 Sunday Times bestseller
'A genuine page-turner, full of intimacies and reflections' Evening Standard
'A polished pearl of a memoir' New York Times
'A rich, entertaining and candid memoir. And overall Obama's a fun person to sit alongside as she tells you the story of her life . . . it is as beautifully written as any piece of fiction' i
In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America - the first African-American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.
In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations - and whose story inspires us to do the same.
'Offers new insights into her upbringing on the south side of Chicago and the highs and lows of life with Barack Obama. . . a refreshing level of honesty about what politics really did to her. I have read Barack Obama's two books so far, and this is like inserting a missing piece of reality into the narrative of his dizzying journey' Guardian

Abdul Kalam	Paperback,– Illustrated, Large Print, Audiobook	4.7 out of 5 stars	379 customer reviews	It was like any other day on the Anna University campus in Chennai. I had delivered a lecture 'Vision to Mission' and the session got extended from one hour to two. I had lunch with a group of research students and went back to class. As I was returning to my rooms in the evening the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you ...' Some months earlier, I had left my post as principal scientific adviser to the government of India, a Cabinet-level post, to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change. Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It offers insight not only into an extraordinary personality but also a vision of how a country with a great heritage can become great in accomplishment, skills and abilities through effort, perseverance and confidence. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey, individual and collective, that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.

The action takes place in Los Angeles.
This book has two main plots running parallel to each other. There is the story of Los Angeles under threat. Then there's the story of a Hollywood celebrity couple and their children who vanish suddenly.
It all begins with the murder of four surfers. There is no clue in the crime scene except a note that just states plainly ""No Prisoners"". This is followed by another similar incident, this time with a demand for ransom from the City of Los Angeles.
The authorities bring in Jack Morgan and his private detective agency to help track down the people responsible. No one is sure if it is just a criminal group that has hit upon a murderous plan to extort money from the city or if it is the work of a terrorist group.
Back at the agency, Justine Smith is asked to investigate a high-profile case. Thom and Jennifer Harlow, Hollywood's high-profile celebrity couple, who have adopted three children and are involved in philanthropic work across the world, have suddenly disappeared without a trace, along with their children.
Jack Morgan tries to track down the persons behind the ""No Prisoners"" killings. Justine investigates the case of the vanished Hollywood couple, the news of which has to be kept a secret, otherwise, it would create a media frenzy. But, the investigation might potentially reveal some secrets that the golden couple might want to keep hidden from the public eye.
Jack is also finding life pretty challenging at the moment. In addition to his headline creating case, he also has personal problems. His twin brother is trying to frame Jack for a murder that he himself might be accused of.

*Walter Clemons
Newsweek

""A PENETRATING, FASCINATING AND REMARKABLY SUSPENSEFUL NARRATIVE.""
*David Guy
Chicago Tribune
In The Amateurs, David Halberstam once again displays the unique brand of reportage, both penetrating and supple, that distinguished his bestselling The Best and the Brightest and October 1964. This time he has taken for his subject the dramatic and special world of amateur rowing. While other athletes are earning fortunes in salaries and-or endorsements, the oarsmen gain fame only with each other and strive without any hope of financial reward.
What drives these men to endure a physical pain known to no other sport? Who are they? Where do they come from? How do they regard themselves and their competitors? What have they sacrificed, and what inner demons have they appeased? In answering these questions, David Halberstam takes as his focus the 1984 single sculls trials in Princeton. The man who wins will gain the right to represent the United States in the 84 Olympiad; the losers will then have to struggle further to gain a place in the two- or four-man boats. And even if they succeed, they will have to live with the bitter knowledge that they were not the best, only close to it.
Informative and compelling, The Amateurs combines the vividness of superb sportswriting with the narrative skills of a Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent.

Brilliant Blunders: From Darwin to Einstein - Colossal Mistakes by Great Scientists That Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe	Mario Livio	Paperback,– 27 May 2014	4.2 out of 5 stars	32 customer reviews	"Drawing on the lives of five great scientists, this “scholarly, insightful, and beautifully written book” (Martin Rees, author of From Here to Infinity) illuminates the path to scientific discovery.

Charles Darwin, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle, and Albert Einstein all made groundbreaking contributions to their fields—but each also stumbled badly. Darwin’s theory of natural selection shouldn’t have worked, according to the prevailing beliefs of his time. Lord Kelvin gravely miscalculated the age of the earth. Linus Pauling, the world’s premier chemist, constructed an erroneous model for DNA in his haste to beat the competition to publication. Astrophysicist Fred Hoyle dismissed the idea of a “Big Bang” origin to the universe (ironically, the caustic name he gave to this event endured long after his erroneous objections were disproven). And Albert Einstein speculated incorrectly about the forces of the universe—and that speculation opened the door to brilliant conceptual leaps. As Mario Livio luminously explains in this “thoughtful meditation on the course of science itself” (The New York Times Book Review), these five scientists expanded our knowledge of life on earth, the evolution of the earth, and the evolution of the universe, despite and because of their errors.

“Thoughtful, well-researched, and beautifully written” (The Washington Post), Brilliant Blunders is a wonderfully insightful examination of the psychology of five fascinating scientists—and the mistakes as well as the achievements that made them famous."

Master and Commander	Patrick O'Brian	Paperback,– Special Edition, 1 Apr 2010	3.1 out of 5 stars	3 customer reviews	"Set sail for the read of your life …
Patrick O’Brian’s Aubrey-Maturin tales are widely acknowledged to be the greatest series of historical novels ever written.
Master and Commander is the first of Patrick O’Brian’s now famous Aubrey/Maturin novels, regarded by many as the greatest series of historical novels ever written. It establishes the friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey RN and Stephen Maturin, who becomes his secretive ship’s surgeon and an intelligence agent. It contains all the action and excitement which could possibly be hoped for in a historical novel, but it also displays the qualities which have put O’Brian far ahead of any of his competitors: his depiction of the detail of life aboard a Nelsonic man-of-war, of weapons, food, conversation and ambience, of the landscape and of the sea. O’Brian’s portrayal of each of these is faultless and the sense of period throughout is acute. His power of characterisation is above all masterly.
This brilliant historical novel marked the début of a writer who grew into one of our greatest novelists ever, the author of what Alan Judd, writing in the Sunday Times, has described as ‘the most significant extended story since Anthony Powell’s A Dance to the Music of Time’."

Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron : Seriously Funny Since1983	Jai Arjun Singh	Paperback,– 28 Dec 2010	3.9 out of 5 stars	12 customer reviews	In the 1980s, an unheralded Hindi movie, made on a budget of less than Rs 7 lakh, went from a quiet showing at the box office to developing a reputation as India's definitive black comedy. Some of the country's finest theatre and film talents - all at key stages in their careers - participated in its creation, but the journey was anything but smooth. Among other things, it involved bumping off disco killers and talking gorillas, finding air-conditioned rooms for dead rats, persuading a respected actor to stop sulking and eat his meals, and resisting the temptation to introduce logic into a madcap script. In the end, it was worth it. Kundan Shah's Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro is now a byword for the sort of absurdist, satirical humours that Hindi cinema just hasn't seen enough of. This is the story of how it came to be despite incredible odds - and what it might have been. Jai Arjun Singh's take on the making of the film and its cult following is as entertaining as the film itself.	Cinema & Broadcast (Books)	Arts, Film & Photography	224.0

Considered a prodigy in scientific research, he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's working homeless and with a toddler son.

Never giving in to despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district.

Empire of the Moghul: Ruler of the World	Alex Rutherford	Paperback,– 8 Dec 2011	3.8 out of 5 stars	33 customer reviews	"Keep your enemies close, and your sons closer...

The story of the third great Moghul Emperor, Akbar, leader of a triumphant dynasty which contained the seeds of its own destruction.

Akbar, ruler of a sixth of the world's people, colossally rich and utterly ruthless, was a contemporary of Elizabeth I, but infinitely more powerful. His reign began in bloodshed when he strangled his treacherous 'milk-brother', but it ended in glory.

Akbar extended his rule over much of Asia, skillfully commanding tens of thousands of men, elephants and innovative technology, yet despite the unimaginable bloodshed which resulted his empire was based on universal religious tolerance.

However, Akbar's homelife was more complicated. He defied family, nobles and mullahs to marry a beautiful Rajput princess, whose people he had conquered; but she hated Akbar and turned Salim, his eldest son, against him. What's more, as any Moghul prince could inherit his father's crown and become Emperor, his sons were brought up to be intensely competitive and suspicious of each other: to see eachother as rivals for the greatest prize of all. And, as Salim grew to manhood, the relationship between father and son became tainted by rebellion and competition to be the greatest Moghul of them all."

Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are partners in a small-time law firm, which they refer to, as a ‘boutique firm'. The Litigators is a novel that focusses on the journey of these two partners, who have been in the business for way too long, if you are to consider their work. All they've been waiting for is their big break in the business, which never seems to come around.
Finley and Figg specialise in quick divorces and similar cases, along with a rare car-wreck case landing up in their kitty as well. Even though these partners argue incessantly, they still manage to earn small amounts from their offices in southwest Chicago.
The story takes an unexpected turn when a young and unemployed attorney named David Zinc makes his appearance and lands up working with Finley and Figg, as their new partner. Things get interesting when Krayoxx, the leading cholesterol-reducing tablet, which is manufactured by Varrick Labs, is under the scanner, for supposedly triggering heart-attacks when consumed. Could this be the life-changing case for Finley, Figg and Zinc? Could there be more to this case, than what meets the eye? The novel answers all of this and much more.
The Litigators is a novel, which has been published in its first edition, by Hodder & Stoughton, in the year 2011 and is available in paperback.

Curbed in the decades after World War II, it has recently returned with a vengeance. We all know the scale of the problem--talk about the 99% and the 1% is entrenched in public debate--but there has been little discussion of what we can do but despair. According to the distinguished economist Anthony Atkinson, however, we can do much more than skeptics imagine. ""[Atkinson] sets forth a list of concrete, innovative, and persuasive proposals meant to show that alternatives still exist, that the battle for social progress and equality must reclaim its legitimacy, here and now... Witty, elegant, profound, this book should be read."" --Thomas Piketty, New York Review of Books ""An uncomfortable affront to our reigning triumphalists.

The Book of Women: Celebrating the Female Spirit (Foundations of a New Humanity)	Osho	Paperback,– Import, 5 Aug 2014	3.1 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"In The Book of Women: A Celebration of Women and the Female Spirit, one of the twentieth century’s greatest spiritual teachers discusses the importance and value of feminine strengths.
“The woman should search into her own soul for her own potential and develop it, and she will have a beautiful future.”―Osho
Osho explores the role of women in our society. Up until now, he says, both religious institutions and politics have remained male-dominated―not only male-dominated but male-chauvinistic. This has created so many of the crises that we see in the world now, brought about by excesses of ambition, competitiveness, and greed.
In these pages, Osho challenges readers to reclaim and assert the feminine qualities of love, joy, and celebration to bring a reunion of the intellect and the heart that is so desperately needed. He looks to the female spirit in all of us as a way to nurture the soul and cultivate a healthy relationship with spirituality.
Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century” and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people―along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha―who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world."	Spirituality	Action & Adventure	263.0

Based on the three-volume first edition that shocked readers when first published in 1891, this edition includes as appendices: Hardy's Prefaces, the Landscapes of Tess, episodes originally censored from the Graphic periodical version, and a selection of the Graphic illustrations.

The Lost Tarot of Nostradamus Kit	John Matthews	Paperback,– 4 Oct 2016	4.4 out of 5 stars	54 customer reviews	"This pack contains 78 full-color tarot cards as well as an illustrated instructional booklet.

In 1994 a researcher working in the Italian National Library in Rome discovered a manuscript containing 80 mysterious paintings, believed to have been devised by the mysterious prophet Michael de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus. The manuscript, never published in his lifetime, was handed down to his son who later presented it to Pope Urban VIII. After that, it remained forgotten and neglected.

A brief glance at these extraordinary images shows how heavily they draw on the symbolism of Tarot. It is the belief of Tarot experts, Matthews and Kinghan, that Nostradamus was designing his own set of cards, drawing upon the visionary insights gleaned from his prophetic writings and visions. Now this Tarot has been brought to fruition by two modern experts and its secrets revealed for the first time.

Visionary artist Wil Kinghan and New York Times best-selling author and longtime student of Tarot, John Matthews have devised a deck which incorporates Nostradamus' images, fully updated to make what will inevitably be judged one of the most important decks of this age."

Democracy's XI: The Great Indian Cricket Story	Rajdeep Sardesai	Hardcover,– 18 Oct 2017	2.4 out of 5 stars	64 customer reviews	Nothing unites India like cricket. The Indian team is a glorious mix of people from different religions, classes, castes, regions and languages; where the son of a pump manager from Ranchi is tightly bound in fate and determination to the child prodigy of a Marathi professor from Mumbai and a Muslim from the back alleys of Hyderabad. And while dynasts can rule the roost in politics and Bollywood, cricket is a meritocratic space. But it wasn't always this way. Gandhi, for instance, intensely disapproved of cricket. During the Raj it was associated with racism. It had the nasty odour of communal division, with Hindus and Muslims playing in separate teams. Dalits, meanwhile, were personas non grata on the field. Bestselling author and journalist Rajdeep Sardesai narrates the story of post-Independence cricket through the lives of eleven extraordinary Indian cricketers who represent different dimensions of this change - from Dilip Sardesai and Tiger Pataudi in the 1950s to M.S. Dhoni and Virat Kohli today. This is not a book about an all-time best Indian cricket eleven but one that seeks to show us glimpses of a changing India through personal and anecdotal biographical portraits. From the days that Indian cricketers travelled by train and earned a few hundred rupees for Test matches to the bright lights of the multimillion-dollar IPL, this book puts the spotlight on the evolution of Indian cricket and society, and shows how a post-colonial nation found self-respect.

‘Smoke and Ashes is Abir Mukherjee's best book yet; a brilliantly conceived murder mystery set amidst political and social turmoil – beautifully crafted’ C.J. Sansom

India, 1921. Captain Sam Wyndham is battling a serious addiction to opium that he must keep secret from his superiors in the Calcutta police force.

But Wyndham finds himself in a tight spot when he stumbles across a corpse in an opium den. When he then comes across a second body bearing the same injuries, Wyndham is convinced that there's a deranged killer on the loose.

However, revealing his presence in the opium den could cost him his career.

As Wyndham and Sergeant 'Surrender-not' Banerjee set out to solve the two murders, Wyndham must tread carefully, keeping his personal demons secret, before someone else turns up dead...

Lamentation (The Shardlake series)	C. J. Sansom	Paperback,– 24 Sep 2015	4.6 out of 5 stars	3 customer reviews	Matthew Shardlake is back in Lamentation, from the number one bestselling author C. J. Sansom. Summer, 1546. King Henry VIII is slowly, painfully dying. His Protestant and Catholic councillors are engaged in a final and decisive power struggle; whoever wins will control the government of Henry's successor, eight-year-old Prince Edward. As heretics are hunted across London, and the radical Protestant Anne Askew is burned at the stake, the Catholic party focus their attack on Henry's sixth wife, Matthew Shardlake's old mentor, Queen Catherine Parr. Shardlake, still haunted by events aboard the warship Mary Rose the year before, is working on the Cotterstoke Will case, a savage dispute between rival siblings. Then, unexpectedly, he is summoned to Whitehall Palace and asked for help by his old patron, the now beleaguered and desperate Queen. For Catherine Parr has a secret. She has written a confessional book, Lamentation of a Sinner, so radically Protestant that if it came to the King's attention it could bring both her and her sympathizers crashing down. But, although the book was kept secret and hidden inside a locked chest in the Queen's private chamber, it has - inexplicably - vanished. Only one page has been found, clutched in the hand of a murdered London printer. Shardlake's investigations take him on a trail that begins among the backstreet printshops of London but leads him and Jack Barak into the dark and labyrinthine world of the politics of the royal court; a world he had sworn never to enter again. Loyalty to the Queen will drive him into a swirl of intrigue inside Whitehall Palace, where Catholic enemies and Protestant friends can be equally dangerous, and the political opportunists, who will follow the wind wherever it blows, more dangerous than either. The theft of Queen Catherine's book proves to be connected to the terrible death of Anne Askew, while his involvement with the Cotterstoke litigants threatens to bring Shardlake himself to the stake. The previous books in the bestselling Shardlake series are Dissolution, Dark Fire, Sovereign, Revelation and Heartstone.	Historical Fiction (Books)	Crime, Thriller & Mystery	205.0

Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, explores the remarkable history of K2 and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time, he probes the mountain's most memorable sagas in order to illustrate lessons about the fundamental questions mountaineering raises—questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and got caught in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death before Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott's.

Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit."

The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce, and Selected Stories (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics Series)	James M. Cain	Hardcover,– 22 Jul 2003	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"These three classics from the master of the noir novel, along with five otherwise unavailable short stories, are electric with the taut narrative voice, the suspense, and the explosive violence and eroticism that were James M. Cain’s indelible hallmarks.
 The Postman Always Rings Twice, Cain’s first novel–the subject of an obscenity trial in Boston, the inspiration for Camus’s The Stranger–is the fever-pitched tale of a drifter who stumbles into a job, into an erotic obsession, and into a murder. Double Indemnity–which followed Postman so quickly, Cain’s readers hardly had a chance to catch their breath–is a tersely narrated story of blind passion, duplicity, and, of course, murder. Mildred Pierce, a work of acute psychological observation and devastating emotional violence, is the tale of a woman with a taste for shiftless men and an unreasoned devotion to her monstrous daughter. All three novels were immortalized in classic Hollywood films. Also included here are five masterful stories–“Pastorale,” “The Baby in the Icebox,” “Dead Man,” “Brush Fire,” “The Girl in the Storm”–that have been out of print for decades."

Cracking the Cube: Going Slow to Go Fast and Other Unexpected Turns in the World of Competitive Rubik's Cube Solving	Ian Scheffler	Hardcover,– 18 Oct 2016	3.2 out of 5 stars	5 customer reviews	"A journalist and aspiring “speedcuber” attempts to break into the international phenomenon of speedsolving the Rubik’s Cube—think chess played at the speed of Ping-Pong—while exploring the Cube’s rise to iconic status around the globe and the lessons that can be learned through solving it.

When Hungarian professor Ernő Rubik invented the Rubik’s Cube (or, rather, his Cube) in the 1970s out of wooden blocks, rubber bands, and paper clips, he didn’t even know if it could be solved, let alone that it would become the world’s most popular puzzle. Since its creation, the Cube has become many things to many people: one of the bestselling children’s toys of all time, a symbol of intellectual prowess, a frustrating puzzle with 43.2 quintillion possible permutations, and now a worldwide sporting phenomenon that is introducing the classic brainteaser to a new generation.

In Cracking the Cube, Ian Scheffler reveals that cubing isn’t just fun and games. Along with participating in speedcubing competitions—from the World Championship to local tournaments—and interviewing key figures from the Cube’s history, he journeys to Budapest to seek a meeting with the legendary and notoriously reclusive Rubik, who is still tinkering away with puzzles in his seventies.

Getting sucked into the competitive circuit himself, Scheffler becomes engrossed in solving Rubik’s Cube in under twenty seconds, the quasi-mystical barrier known as “sub-20,” which is to cubing what four minutes is to the mile: the difference between the best and everyone else. For Scheffler, the road to sub-20 is not just about memorizing algorithms or even solving the Rubik’s Cube. As he learns from the many gurus who cross his path, from pint-sized kids to engineering professors, it’s about learning to solve yourself."	Encyclopaedias & Reference Works (Books)	Sports	444.0

The scar on Rhoda Gradwyn's face was to be the death of her . . .
When the notorious investigative journalist, Rhoda Gradwyn, books into Mr Chandler-Powell's private clinic in Dorset for the removal of a disfiguring and long-standing scar, she has every prospect of a successful operation and the beginning of a new life. But the Manor holds a secret and deadly enemy. While she lies drowsily recovering from the anaesthetic a white-shrouded figure stealthily enters her bedroom and within minutes Rhoda is dead.
Dalgliesh and his team, called in to investigate the murder, and later a second equally horrific death, find themselves confronted with problems even more complicated than the question of innocence or guilt.

Content Inc.: How Entrepreneurs Use Content to Build Massive Audiences and Create Radically Successful Businesses	Joe Pulizzi	Hardcover,– 8 Sep 2015	4.5 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"The NEW Rulebook for Entrepreneurial Success
What’s the surest way to startup failure? Follow old, outdated rules.
In Content Inc., one of today’s most sought-after content-marketing strategists reveals a new model for entrepreneurial success. Simply put, it’s about developing valuable content, building an audience around that content, and then creating a product for that audience.
Notice a shift?
Author Joe Pulizzi flips the traditional entrepreneurial approach of first creating a product and then trying to find customers. It’s a brilliant reverse-engineering of a model that rarely succeeds.
The radical six-step business-building process revealed in this book is smart, simple, practical, and cost-effective. And best of all, it works. It’s a strategy Pulizzi used to build his own successful company, Content Marketing Institute, which has landed on Inc. magazine’s list of fastest growing private companies for three years straight.  It’s also a strategy countless other entrepreneurs use to build their own multi-million dollar companies.  Build an audience and you’ll be able to sell pretty much anything you want.
Today’s markets are more dynamic and customers are more fickle than ever before. Why would you put all your eggs in one basket before securing a loyal customer base? Content Inc. shows you how to get customers first and develop products later. It’s the best way to build a solid, long-lasting business positioned for today’s content-driven world.  This is the simple but profoundly successful entrepreneurial approach of one of today’s most creative business minds.
A pioneer of content marketing, Pulizzi has cracked to code when it comes to the power of content in a world where marketers still hold fast to traditional models that no longer work. In Content Inc., he breaks down the business-startup process into six steps, making it simple for you to visualize, launch, and monetize your own business. These steps are:
• The “Sweet Spot”: Identify the intersection of your unique competency and your personal passion
• Content Tilting: Determine how you can “tilt” your sweet spot to find a place where little or no competition exists
• Building the Base: Establish your number-one channel for disseminating content (blog, podcast, YouTube, etc.)
• Harvesting Audience: Use social-media and SEO to convert one-time visitors into long-term subscribers
• Diversification: Grow your business by expanding into multiple delivery channels
• Monetization: Now that your expertise is established, you can begin charging money for your products or services
This model has worked wonders for Pulizzi and countless other examples detailed in the book. Connect these six pieces like a puzzle, and before you know it, you’ll be running your own profitable, scalable business.
Pulizzi walks you step by step through the process, based on his own success (and failures) and real-world multi-million dollar examples from multiple industries and countries.
Whether you’re seeking to start a brand-new business or drive innovation in an existing one, Content Inc. provides everything you need to reverse-engineer the traditional entrepreneurial model for better, more sustainable success.
Joe Pulizzi is an entrepreneur, professional speaker, and podcaster. He is the founder of several startups, including the Content Marketing Institute (CMI), recognized as the fastest growing business media company by Inc. magazine in 2014. CMI produces Content Marketing World, the world’s largest content marketing event, and publishes the leading content marketing magazine, Chief Content Officer. Pulizzi’s book Epic Content Marketing was named one of Fortune magazine’s Five Must Read Business Books of the Year.

Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story	Karan Thapar	Hardcover,– Import, 18 Jul 2018	4.2 out of 5 stars	85 customer reviews	Sometime in the late summer of 1976, Sanjay Gandhi asked if I wanted to go flying with him... After first attempting to teach Karan Thapar to fly (not very successfully) Sanjay Gandhi took the controls and performed a series of aerobatics, not particularly dangerous but nonetheless thrilling. Once they were further away from Delhi, he became even more daring. Suddenly, he decided to scare the farmers working in the fields below by aiming the aircraft straight at them. As he dived down, they scattered and ran, fearing for their lives. At the last moment, Sanjay pulled up dramatically and waved at the bewildered farmers, clearly chuffed with the whole performance. The manoeuvre required nerves of steel and tremendous self-confidence, both of which Sanjay possessed in plenty. In Devil's Advocate, Karan dives deep into his life to come up with many such moments. Included here are stories of warm and lasting friendships, such as with Benazir Bhutto, whom he met while he was an undergraduate. He also talks about his long association with Aung San Suu Kyi and Rajiv Gandhi. However, not all friendships lasted-for example, with L.K. Advani, with whom he shared a close bond until an unfortunate disagreement over an interview caused a falling-out. The tension generated during an interview has spilled over off-screen multiple times, and Karan discusses these incidents in detail. For instance, when Amitabh Bachchan lost his cool during a post-interview lunch or when Kapil Dev cried like a baby. And there's the untold story of two of his most controversial interviews-with Jayalalithaa and Narendra Modi. While Jayalalithaa laughed it off later, the after-effects of Modi's infamous walkout have grown worse with time. Riveting and fast-paced, Devil's Advocate is as no-holds-barred as any of Karan Thapar's interviews.	Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)	Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts	396.0

In his fast-paced, clear-sighted narrative, Sidhu tracks the reasons behind New Delhi's shift from a long-standing pro-Chogyal stand to a pro-democracy position and maps the political alignments on the ground in Sikkim. He outlines the interplay of personalities-Indira Gandhi, the Chogyal, the Kazi, and the Indian officials and intelligence agencies involved-to reveal the chain of events that led to the merger of the Himalayan kingdom with India."

The Animator's Survival Kit: A Manual of Methods, Principles and Formulas for Classical, Computer, Games, Stop Motion and Internet Animators	Richard Williams	Paperback,– 8 Dec 2009	4.7 out of 5 stars	56 customer reviews	"The definitive book on animation, from the Academy Award-winning animator behind Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

Animation is one of the hottest areas of filmmaking today--and the master animator who bridges the old generation and the new is Richard Williams. During his fifty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by Toy Story.

Perhaps even more important, though, has been his dedication in passing along his knowledge to a new generation of animators so that they in turn could push the medium in new directions. In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs. Urging his readers to ""invent but be believable,"" he illustrates his points with hundreds of drawings, distilling the secrets of the masters into a working system in order to create a book that will become the standard work on all forms of animation for professionals, students, and fans."

Whether it's from Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, The Karate Kid, or Kung Fu Panda, Jackie is admired by generations of moviegoers for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and mind-bending stunts. In 2016-after fifty-six years in the industry, over 200 films, and many broken bones-he received an honorary Academy Award for his lifetime achievement in film. But at 64 years-old, Jackie is just getting started. Now, in Never Grow Up, the global superstar reflects on his early life, including his childhood years at the China Drama Academy (in which he was enrolled at the age of six), his big breaks (and setbacks) in Hong Kong and Hollywood, his numerous brushes with death (both on and off film sets), and his life as a husband and father (which has been, admittedly and regrettably, imperfect). Jackie has never shied away from his mistakes. Since The Young Master in 1980, Jackie's films have ended with a bloopers reel in which he stumbles over his lines, misses his mark, or crashes to the ground in a stunt gone south. In Never Grow Up, Jackie applies the same spirit of openness to his life, proving time and time again why he's beloved the world over: he's honest, funny, kind, brave beyond reckoning and-after all this time-still young at heart.

The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany's Bid for World Power, 1898-1918	Sean McMeekin	Paperback,– 24 May 2011	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	WINNER OF THE BARBARA JELAVICH BOOK PRIZE 'Sean McMeekin has written a classic of First World War history ... This superb and original book is the reality behind Greenmantle' Norman Stone The Berlin-Baghdad Express explores one of the big, previously unresearched subjects of the First World War: the German bid for world power - and the destruction of the British Empire - through the harnessing of the Ottoman Empire. McMeekin's book shows how incredibly high the stakes were in the Middle East - with the Germans in the tantalizing position of taking over the core of the British Empire via the extraordinary railway that would link Central Europe and the Persian Gulf. Germany sought the Ottoman Empire as an ally to create jihad against the British - whose Empire at the time was the largest Islamic power in the world. The Berlin-Baghdad Express is a fascinating account of western interference in the Middle East and its lamentable results. It explains and brings to life a massive area of fighting, which in most other accounts is restricted to the disaster at Gallipoli and the British invasions of Iraq and Palestine.

Kasparov uses his unrivaled experience to look into the future of intelligent machines and sees it bright with possibility. As many critics decry artificial intelligence as a menace, particularly to human jobs, Kasparov shows how humanity can rise to new heights with the help of our most extraordinary creations, rather than fear them.

Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think (Exponential Technology Series)	Peter H. Diamandis	Paperback,– 23 Sep 2014	4.7 out of 5 stars	34 customer reviews	"The New York Times bestselling “manifesto for the future that is grounded in practical solutions addressing the world’s most pressing concerns: overpopulation, food, water, energy, education, health care and freedom” (The Wall Street Journal).

Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing—fast.

In Abundance, space entrepreneur turned innovation pioneer Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler document how progress in artificial intelligence, robotics, digital manufacturing synthetic biology, and other exponentially growing technologies will enable us to make greater gains in the next two decades than we have in the previous 200 years. We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every person on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp.

Breaking down human needs by category—water, food, energy, healthcare, education, freedom—Diamandis and Kotler introduce us to innovators and industry captains making tremendous strides in each area. “Not only is Abundance a riveting page-turner…but it’s a book that gives us a future worth fighting for. And even more than that, it shows us our place in that fight” (The Christian Science Monitor)."	Action & Adventure (Books)	Action & Adventure	395.1

101 Things I Learned in Architecture School (The MIT Press)	Matthew Frederick	Hardcover,– 9 Oct 2007	3.5 out of 5 stars	13 customer reviews	"Concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation, from the basics of ""How to Draw a Line"" to the complexities of color theory. This is a book that students of architecture will want to keep in the studio and in their backpacks. It is also a book they may want to keep out of view of their professors, for it expresses in clear and simple language things that tend to be murky and abstruse in the classroom. These 101 concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation-from the basics of ""How to Draw a Line"" to the complexities of color theory-provide a much-needed primer in architectural literacy, making concrete what too often is left nebulous or open-ended in the architecture curriculum. Each lesson utilizes a two-page format, with a brief explanation and an illustration that can range from diagrammatic to whimsical. The lesson on ""How to Draw a Line"" is illustrated by examples of good and bad lines; a lesson on the dangers of awkward floor level changes shows the television actor Dick Van Dyke in the midst of a pratfall; a discussion of the proportional differences between traditional and modern buildings features a drawing of a building split neatly in half between the two. Written by an architect and instructor who remembers well the fog of his own student days, 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School provides valuable guideposts for navigating the design studio and other classes in the architecture curriculum. Architecture graduates-from young designers to experienced practitioners-will turn to the book as well, for inspiration and a guide back to basics when solving a complex design problem."

Powder Room: The Untold Story of Indian Fashion	Shefalee Vasudev	Hardcover,– 1 Jul 2012	5.0 out of 5 stars	4 customer reviews	"About The Book
Ever been intrigued by the Indian Fashion Industry—its stereotypes of drugged models, gay designers, and fascinating but unaffordable clothes?
Join Shefalee Vasudev, former editor of Marie Claire and an acclaimed fashion journalist, on a deep‑sea dive into the gagging depths of Indian fashion. In Powder Room, she offers an insider’s view of people who make the industry what it is—from a lower middle class girl who sells global luxury for a living to a designer who fights the inner demons of child sexual abuse yet manages to survive and thrive in the business of fashion, or a Ludhiana housewife on a perpetual fashion high.
Besides candid interviews of known names in Indian fashion, Shefalee provides a commentary on new social behaviour, urban culture, generational differences, and the compulsions behind conspicuous consumption in a country splitting at the seams with inequalities of opportunity and wealth. From Nagaland to Patan, Mumbai, Delhi, and Punjab, Powder Room mirrors how and why India ‘does’ fashion.

Calypso	David Sedaris	Hardcover,– 20 Aug 2018	4.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny - it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's writing has never been sharper and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future. This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumour joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet - and it just might be his very best.	Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)	Humour	854.0

The Indian Newsroom	Sandeep Bhushan	Hardcover,– 25 Apr 2019	5.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"An account of the Indian television newsroom is, in some ways, the story of post-liberalisation India itself. In just two decades, the country grew from state-owned Doordarshan’s monopoly to a market dominated by umpteen private news channels. English-language news has a particularly interesting trajectory here, both because of its disproportionate inﬂuence on the national conversation and its proximity to power.
In this personal-is-political history of the television industry in India, veteran journalist Sandeep Bhushan takes an unﬂinching look at his own profession. What caused the death of ﬁeld-based reportage, and the marginalisation of reporters? What is access journalism, and what’s wrong with it? How did India evolve the star system? How did technology inﬂuence the development of the Indian newsroom? Is the reporter–editor relationship necessarily adversarial? How does the owner-editor system, perhaps unique to India, work in practice? What about corporate ownership? And importantly, how does India compare to more mature industries, like those in the USA or UK?
The Indian Newsroom is a straight-talking, behind-the-scenes look at the crisis in Indian news television by one of the best in the business, offering an examination of the choices that lie ahead for India—and the industry."	Media Studies	Politics	458.0

The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.	Clayborne Carson	Paperback,– 1 Jan 2001	4.9 out of 5 stars	10 customer reviews	"With knowledge, spirit, good humor, and passion, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. brings to life a remarkable man whose thoughts and actions speak to our most burning contemporary issues and still inspire the desires, hopes, and dreams of us all.

Written in his own words, this history-making autobiography is Martin Luther King: the mild-mannered, inquisitive child and student who chafed under and eventually rebelled against segregation; the dedicated young minister who continually questioned the depths of his faith and the limits of his wisdom; the loving husband and father who sought to balance his family's needs with those of a growing, nationwide movement; and the reflective, world-famous leader who was fired by a vision of equality for people everywhere.

Relevant and insightful, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. offers King's seldom disclosed views on some of the world's greatest and most controversial figures: John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Nixon. It also paints a rich and moving portrait of a people, a time, and a nation in the face of powerful change. Finally, it shows how everyday Americans from all walks of life confronted themselves, each other, and the burden of the past-and how their fears and courage helped shape our future."

The Google Guys skips past the general Google story and focuses on what really drives the company's founders. Richard L. Brandt shows the company as the brainchild of two brilliant individuals and looks at Google's business decisions in light of its founders' ambition and beliefs.

Larry is the main strategist, with business acumen and practical drive, while Sergey is the primary technologist and idealist, with brilliant ideas and strong moral positions. But they work closely together, almost like complementary halves of a single brain.

Through interviews with current and former employees, competitors, partners, and senior Google management, plus conversations with the founders themselves, Brandt demystifies the company while clarifying a number of misconceptions."

The End: My Struggle Book 6	Karl Ove Knausgaard	Paperback,– Import, 30 Aug 2018	5.0 out of 5 stars	1 customer review	"**A Guardian, The Times, Daily Telegraph, Financial Times and The Week Book of the Year 2018**

The extraordinary final volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s monumental My Struggle series, ‘perhaps the most significant literary enterprise of our times’ (Guardian)

The End is the sixth and final book in the monumental My Struggle cycle. Here, Karl Ove Knausgaard examines life, death, love and literature with unsparing rigour and begins to count the cost of his project.

This last volume reflects on the fallout from the earlier books, with Knausgaard facing the pressures of literary acclaim and its often shattering repercussions. The End is at once a meditation on writing and its relationship with reality, and an account of a writer’s relationship with himself – his ambitions, his doubts and frailties.

My Struggle depicts life in all its shades, from moments of great drama to seemingly trivial everyday details. It is a project freighted with risk, where the bounds between private and public worlds are tested, not without penalty for the author himself and those around him. The End is the capstone on an unparalleled achievement."	Action & Adventure (Books)	Action & Adventure	724.0

Pep Confidential: The Inside Story of Pep Guardiola's First Season at Bayern Munich	Marti Perarnau	Paperback,– 16 Oct 2014	4.8 out of 5 stars	7 customer reviews	'Access inside the changing room and behind the scenes that any journalist or writer would kill for - Perarnau's insights are astonishing' - Graham Hunter 'Write about everything you see. Be as critical as you like' - Pep Guardiola to Marti Perarnau, summer 2013 Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during season 2013-14. This book represents the first time in the modern era that a writer has got this close to one of the elite teams of world football. At the invitation of Pep Guardiola, he shadowed the Catalan, his staff and his superstar players during training and on matchdays. Bayern smashed domestic records on their way to the double, but were humiliated by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final. Perarnau was with them every step of the way. Perarnau is with Guardiola as he is courted by the world's greatest clubs during his sabbatical in New York. We hear Guardiola explain in detail the radical tactical moves which transform Bayern's season and reprogramme the players who will win the World Cup with Germany.Perarnau talks exclusively and in fascinating detail with players such as Arjen Robben, Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Thiago Alcantara and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Pep Confidential is much more than the story of a season - it is also a lasting portrait of one of the greatest coaches in sport. Marti Perarnau, former Spanish Olympiad turned journalist, is a renowned football analyst. He writes for a number of Spanish newspapers and runs the hugely popular Perarnau Magazine blog.

The Afghan	Frederick Forsyth	Paperback,– 13 Aug 2007	3.9 out of 5 stars	41 customer reviews	"When British and American intelligence catch wind of a major Al Qaeda operation in the works, they are primed for action - but what can they do? They know nothing about the attack: the what, where or when. They have no sources in Al Qaeda, and it's impossible to plant someone. Impossible, unless . . .

The Afghan is Izmat Khan, a five-year prisoner of Guantanamo Bay and a former senior commander of the Taliban. The Afghan is also Colonel Mike Martin, a 25-year veteran of war zones around the world, a dark, lean man born and raised in Iraq. In an attempt to stave off disaster, the intelligence agencies will try to do what no one has ever done before - pass off a Westerner as an Arab among Arabs - pass off Martin as the trusted Khan.

It will require extraordinary preparation, and then extraordinary luck, for nothing can truly prepare Martin for the dark and shifting world he is about to enter. Or for the terrible things he will find there . . .

The Day of the Jackal, The Dogs of War, The Odessa File - the books of Frederick Forsyth have helped define the international thriller as we know it today. Combining meticulous research with crisp narratives and plots as current as the headlines, Forsyth shows us the world as it is, in a way that few have ever been able to equal.

And the world as it is today is a very scary place . . ."	Action & Adventure (Books)	Crime, Thriller & Mystery	364.0

Reversible Errors: A Novel	Scott Turow	Hardcover,– Import, 1 Nov 2002	4.0 out of 5 stars	2 customer reviews	"A super-charged, exquisitely suspenseful novel about a vicious triple murder and the man condemned to die for it
Rommy ""Squirrel"" Gandolph is a Yellow Man, an inmate on death row for a 1991 triple murder in Kindle County. His slow progress toward certain execution is nearing completion when Arthur Raven, a corporate lawyer who is Rommy's reluctant court-appointed representative, receives word that another inmate may have new evidence that will exonerate Gandolph.
Arthur's opponent in the case is Muriel Wynn, Kindle County's formidable chief deputy prosecuting attorney, who is considering a run for her boss's job. Muriel and Larry Starczek, the original detective on the case, don't want to see Rommy escape a fate they long ago determined he deserved, for a host of reasons. Further complicating the situation is the fact that Gillian Sullivan, the judge who originally found Rommy guilty, is only recently out of prison herself, having served time for taking bribes.
Scott Turow's compelling, multi-dimensional characters take the reader into Kindle County's parallel yet intersecting worlds of police and small-time crooks, airline executives and sophisticated scammers--and lawyers of all stripes. No other writer offers such a convincing true-to-life picture of how the law and life interact, or such a profound understanding of what is at stake--personally, professionally, and morally--when the state holds the power to end a man's life."

Tell Me your Dreams	Sidney Sheldon	Paperback,– 17 Aug 1998	4.4 out of 5 stars	174 customer reviews	"Tell Me Your Dreams is a novel by best-selling American author Sydney Sheldon. The book is about the lives of three very different women, and how events over the course of the story reveal that they are interconnected in a way no one would ever imagine.
Ashley Patterson is a hardworking woman in her late 20s. Her co-worker Toni Prescott is just the opposite: bold and vivacious, and Alette Peters is a shy artist. The protagonist Ashley fears that someone is following her, because she finds that her house and her belongings are not the way she left them. She requests for a police officer’s protection. However, the next morning, the man is found murdered in her apartment. Similarly, two other murders had taken place earlier, with identical patterns to the current one. Investigations begin, and the police force discover evidence pointing to the fact that all the three murders are connected to the same woman. This seems virtually impossible though, because all of them have taken place in different cities. A chance discovery leads them to stumble upon the truth, which shocks them all considerably. Tell Me Your Dreams is a dark, sinister and fast-paced novel on a subject which has intrigued the medical world for many years together.

Rewire - How To Be The Leader Of Your Own Life	Jay Kumar Hariharan	Paperback,– 6 May 2019	4.8 out of 5 stars	12 customer reviews	You are meant to become the best version of yourself; that is your dharma. You owe this not to the world, but to yourself. How can you reinvent yourself inside out when the lightness of being is replaced by the heaviness of it all? When most of your material boxes have been checked, how to embrace the void and refuel yourself? Author Jay Kumar Hariharan delves into years of asking himself and others questions on what constitutes ‘success’ and ‘meaning’. Why do many of us suffer from poverty in the midst of abundance? There is a vast need to reflect and be conscious of choices and dreams instead of accepting the status quo. Jay delivers interesting insights by connecting the dots and drawing patterns between highly disparate influences.

The Doors Of Perception: And Heaven and Hell	Aldous Huxley	Paperback,– 2 Sep 2004	4.6 out of 5 stars	3 customer reviews	"WITH A FOREWORD J.G. BALLARD

In 1953, in the presence of an investigator, Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gramme of mescalin, sat down and waited to see what would happen. When he opened his eyes everything, from the flowers in a vase to the creases in his trousers, was transformed. Huxley described his experience with breathtaking immediacy in The Doors of Perception. In its sequel Heaven and Hell, he goes on to explore the history and nature of mysticism. Still bristling with a sense of excitement and discovery, these illuminating and influential writings remain the most fascinating account of the visionary experience ever written."
